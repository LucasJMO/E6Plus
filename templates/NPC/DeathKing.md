## Requirements

A death king is a powerful warrior who died and was the subject of an attempted resurrection, either as an undead (with animate dead for example) or living (with raise dead for example). The death king's experiences beyond the veil have irrevocably changed them, though they are living beings (their type is the same as before their death) they do not age, instead remaining eternally at the age they were at the time of their death. Good or neutral characters who become death kings have their alignment changed to evil.

**Hit Dice**: A death king's hit dice change to d12.

**Fast Healing**: A death king gains fast healing 1.

**Gaze of the Terrible**: As a swift action, a death king can target an opponent within short range who meets its gaze with a fear effect. This effect is handled as the spell, but targets only a single opponent.

**Horrors from Beyond**: As a swift action, a death king can target an opponent within short range with a hideous apparition. Targets of this ability must attempt a Will save (DC 16) or take 3d6 damage.

**Mantle of Death**: A death king is immune to all mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, physical ability score damage, fatigue and exhaustion effects, any effect that requires a fortitude save, and death effects.

If a death king is reduced to 0 or fewer hitpoints they automatically remain conscious and stable.

**Natural Armor**: A death king's natural armor increases by 5.

**Regeneration**: A death king gains regeneration 1, magic, magical weapons, and silver weapons deal normal damage to a death king.
