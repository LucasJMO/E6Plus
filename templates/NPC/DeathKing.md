## Requirements

A death king is a powerful warrior who died and was the subject of an attempted resurrection, either as an undead (with animate dead for example) or living (with raise dead for example). The death king's experiences beyond the veil have irrevocably changed them, though they are living beings (their type is the same as before their death) they do not age, instead remaining eternally at the age they were at the time of their death. Good or neutral characters who become death kings have their alignment changed to evil.

**Hit Dice**: A death king's hit dice change to d12.

**Fast Healing**: A death king gains fast healing 1.

**Gaze of the Terrible**: As a standard action, a death king can target an opponent within short range who meets its gaze with a fear effect. This effect is handled as the spell, but targets only a single opponent. The save DC to resist is 13 plus the death king's Charisma modifier.

**Horrors from Beyond**: As a swift action, a death king can target an opponent within short range with a hideous apparition. Targets of this ability must attempt a Will save (DC 16 plus the death king's Charisma modifier) or take 3d6 damage. This is a fear effect.

**Mantle of Death**: A death king is immune to all mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, physical ability score damage, fatigue and exhaustion effects, any effect that requires a fortitude save, and death effects. They are not subject to critical hits, ability drain, or energy drain, and do not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. If a death king is reduced to 0 or fewer hitpoints they automatically remain conscious and stable.

**Natural Armor**: A death king's natural armor increases by 3.

**Regeneration**: A death king gains regeneration 1, magic, magical weapons, and silver weapons deal normal damage to a death king.

**King's Servants**: A death king gains the ability to resurrect creatures who have been dead for any stretch of time, these creatures are placed in the same state as the death king, they do not age, instead remaining eternally as they were at the time of their death. A king's servant does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and if they are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points they automatically remain conscious and stable. These servants obey the death king without question, while they are within 10 miles of him they are able to communicate telepathically, and the death king can see through their eyes.

A death king may have four of these such servants at any time, if one dies or is dismissed (a free action by the death king) their body rots to nothing and vanishes. Raising a new servant requires the death king to perform a weeklong ritual on the desired corpse.
