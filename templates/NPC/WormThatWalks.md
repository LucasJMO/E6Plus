# Worm that Walks

Worm that Walks is an acquired template which can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature.

## Requirements

A worm that walks is a powerful (though not necessarily evil) caster who died violently in pursuit of a singular goal, and was then left in a place where his body would be eaten by maggots.

The caster reincarnates as a sentient swarm of worms which take the form of a man. A worm gains an intense focus on accomplishing whatever their goal was before their death. And may never be satisfied that it has been completed. Instead pursuing it tirelessly until its final destruction.

In order to become a worm that walks a character must be 6th level and have the ability to cast 3rd level spells.

**Type**:

**Hit Dice**: A worm's hit dice increase to d10

**AC**:

**Engulf**(Ex):

**Discorporate**(Ex): A worm can discorporate as a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that slither quickly away, making their escape by burrowing into the earth, slipping through holes in the wainscoting, or the like. So long as any of the component vermin survive, they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard's intelligence and personality.

Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin. Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment. However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for the worm's continued existence.

After discorporating, a worm requires 3 months to reform, after one month they regain consciousness as a 2d10 HD Tiny mass of vermin, in this state they suffer a -10 penalty to their physical ability scores (reducing them to a minimum of 1), may only cast 1st level(or below) spells.

After two months they become a 4d10 HD Small mass of vermin, the -10 penalty decreases to -5, and they regain the ability to cast 2nd level spells. Finally at 3 months they are restored to full strength.

Each time a worm that walks discorporates it loses more memories of itself before its transformation. Instead it gains even more focus on whatever goal initially drove its transformation.

**Blind Sight**(Ex):

**Ooze Traits**:
