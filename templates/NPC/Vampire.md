# Vampire

Vampire is an acquired template which can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature. The creature's type changes to undead. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.


## Requirements

A vampire is a powerful warrior who died some time after being bitten by another vampire. Unless their body is burned, or their head is severed they will rise after 3 days as another vampire.

In order to become a vampire a character must be 6th level. A character below 6th level who is bitten and then dies instead rises as one hit dice zombie.

**Hit Dice**: A vampire's hit dice increase to d12.

**Natural Armor**: A vampire's natural armor improves by +3.

**Petrifying Gaze**: A vampire may use a standard action to make a gaze attack against an opponent. Anyone targeted by the vampire must succeed a will save DC 13 + the vampire's Charisma Modifier or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds.

**Blood Drain**: A vampire can expend a full round action to suck blood from a living victim who is either petrified or asleep, or a freshly deceased (less than 10 minutes) corpse. Living victims who have blood drained take 1d4 permanent Constitution drain per round the vampire drains their blood. 

A vampire who goes for a week without draining at least 10 points of Constitution from a creature of his same race suffers 3 points of Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom damage, however gains a +1 bonus to Strength and Dexterity. A vampire whose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma score is reduced to 0 by this damage becomes inanimate, resembling a corpse which does not decompose. A vampire who sucks blood (or ingests fresh blood from another source) removes all ability score damage or enhancements.

**Create Spawn**: A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by the vampire's blood drain rises as a vampire spawn 1d4 days after burial. Spawn are under the command of the vampire and remain enslaved until their master's death.

A vampire can control up to 4 spawn concurrently, and any other creatures who would rise as spawn instead rise as 1HD zombies.

**Damage Reduction**: A vampire gains damage reduction 2/silver or magic.

**Turn Resistance**: A vampire has +4 turn resistance.

**Resistance**: A vampire has cold and electricity resistance 10.

**Fast Healing**: A vampire heals a point of damage each round so long as it has 1 hit point.

**Gaseous Form**: As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will, as the spell cast by a 5th-level sorcerer, but can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
