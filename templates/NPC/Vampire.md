# Vampire

Vampire is an acquired template which can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature. The creature's type changes to undead. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Blood Drain**: A vampire can expend a full round action to suck blood from a living victim who is either petrified or asleep, or a freshly deceased (less than 10 minutes) corpse. Living victims who have blood drained take 1d4 permanent Constitution drain per round the vampire drains their blood. 

A vampire who goes for a week without draining blood suffers a point of Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom damage, however gains a +1 bonus to Strength and Dexterity. A vampire whose Wisdom or Intelligence score is reduced to 0 by this damage becomes inanimate, resembling a corpse which does not decompose. A vampire who sucks blood (or ingests fresh blood from another source) removes all ability score damage or enhancements.
