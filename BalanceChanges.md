Barbarian: STR 18, Greatsword 2d6 (19-20/x2)
Full Attack: 20.5
Skirmish: 14.5
Rage FA: 24.8
Rage S: 19.15
AC: 10 + 5/4 + Dex = 16-18 with DR/2
So skirmish is the likely one on the cutting block, then maybe Greater Fast Movement, I think DR, healing, the D12, and Rage keep this class totally reasonable.
NERF

Bard: This is a bit confusing since they're not really locked in as melee or ranged, I think they're reasonably (?) balanced, but maybe they're just a very strong archery/magic class. 
Composite Longbow, 16 dex, 12 strength
Full Attack: .7*5.5+.05*11+.45*5.5+.05*11: 7.425
Rapid Shot: 2(.6*5.5+.05*11)+.35*5.5+.05*11: 10.175
AC: 10 + 5/4 + Dex = 16-19
I think strength here really depends on spell selection, this seems ok. Maybe could be a bit stronger.
KEEP SAME/BUFF

Blackguard: STR 18, Greatsword 2d6 (19-20/x2)
Full Attack: 20.5
AC: 19+ (full plate, +1 dex, maybe shield?)
Very tanky, slightly more aggressive version of paladin. Going to nerf spell selection slightly, will do the same with paladin.
Change spell selection to 1st - 1,1,2. 2nd - 1
NERF

Cleric:
Probably fine, d8 hit dice is fairly beefy, high AC with full plate and a shield. Powerful and flexible. Honestly could probably get rid of the bonus feat.
KEEP SAME/NERF

Diploconvoker: (Kind of a jank class but I made it for a friend so idk)
I think it's reasonable? But honestly I'm not sure, it needs some playtesting. It's hard to weight how all of these summoning mechanics work together.
He's fragile though so I don't think he's OP, the elemental summoning mechanic is cool, but I can't help but wonder if I haven't just made this a weak version of a summoning focused Druid/Sorc.
I kind of think I have, maybe improve the HD to d6? We'll see.
KEEP SAME

Dread Necromancer:
Damage: Charnel touch does not scale at all. Negative Energy Burst is a mixed damage/healing mechanic, the damage also isn't great for just a 3/day. 
Not a damage dealing class with those mechanics, but the fear at will is quite good.
I think this is ok, it's a weird class but it has flexible casting with advanced learning, DR/4, d6 hit die. I think it's pretty strong at 6th level, but getting there might be risky.
KEEP SAME

Druid: 
Good, very flexible with casting, animal companion, and wild shape. A perfectly strong class.
KEEP SAME

HorizonWalker:
This is a very strange one, you have a collection of powers that aren't really combat related, then horizon step and horizon guide.
The d10 HD and full BAB means you're probably pretty good at whatever kind of combat you choose to do. I think you're encouraged to lean Dex because you can't wear plate armor.
A potential build has 18 dex, 14 str, 14 con, knowledge devotion lets him keep up a bit more with damage if he invests points in knowledge. 
You're probably a ranger because of dex, overall I think this is an ok combat class with some fun weird stuff.
KEEP SAME

Jester: The jester has a lot of goodies, 2nd level spells (a decent selection), 3d6 sneak attack, killer clown, jester's feint, pratfall. I think killer clown could probably use a nerf, they're likely to be rolling at a +13 vs an opponent rolling at +6-10, so a ~20% chance of winning the check.
Frightened is pretty strong, losing 3 rounds is a lot. Maybe if they fail they're shaken and flee for one round, then they get to save again at the start of the next round to see if they continue fleeing.
This seems a strong class, lots of ways to get sneak attacks, lots of goodies if you're getting sneak attacks.
KEEP SAME

Knight: The tankiest tank that ever tanked a tank. Also maybe revise the code of conduct? I like the idea but it's a bit silly as it currently exists.
This one is weird, since there's no reason to play this class if you're not using a shield. So the damage is going to be solidly worse than any of the other STR melee boys.
If you invest a feat into exotic weapon proficiency you can have a bastard sword, against AC 15 your average damage on a full attack is like 12.5-14.5 depending on 16 or 18 str.
But you can reasonably have 27+AC, DR4, energy resistance 10. The sort of issue is that against intelligent enemies they can just know to not attack you. 
I think this is a fairly situational class, but I like it and think it should stay about the same.
KEEP SAME

Marshall: I like this one, big stick guy who gives buffs, heals, improves saves, and gives rerolls. Seems strong and fair.
KEEP SAME

Martial Artist: Another weird one, I think that I could stand to lower the AC bonus at 6th level to 5 or 6, 7 seems excessive. Maybe lower the AC but add the unarmored speed bonus back in.
REALLY LOOK THROUGH THIS ONE

Monk: Moved this one to unfinished

Paladin: Same as blackguard, maybe nerf spell progression.
NERF

Pyrokineticist: Minor buffs I think, make it so instead of 2d8 he gets 3d6, and give him +2 to hit with this weapon
BUFF
Greatsword, 18 STR, +2, 2d8
18.9
Greatsword, 18 STR, +3, 2d8

Greatsword, 18 STR, +2, 3d6

20.85

Pyromancer: Change fire bolts so that it loses damage as it goes out. I think every 40 feet it loses 1d4 of damage. 
NERF

Ranger: A powerful all rounder, could maybe stand to be nerfed, but the only thing that really leaps out is how cheese favored enemy can be if you just dump it into one common enemy type. I'd say make it so that you can't double up on the favored enemy enhancement. SLIGHT NERF

Rogue: Probably gave this class too many goodies, but we'll see. Pretty squishy in combat, but tons of skill points, the special abilities can be quite good, and 3d6 sneak attack.
KEEP SAME

Shadowdancer: I think the companion needs a limit on the range it can go away from its master, to restrict just teleporting away. I think I've gotta add a per day limit to the teleport or really up the cooldown or something. This class needs to be brought down a bit I think. NERF

Soldier: So active assault should be changed so that you only get one 5 foot step per round, but it can be used as an immediate action. That way it's not such a strong defensive ability. Maybe I should also make it that foil action is a save opposed to the the soldier's concentration check or something? NERF

SongweaverBard: Could be worth increasing the range of his songs actually, this guy is very strong, but also completely reliant on his teammates to be useful. BUFF/KEEP SAME

Sorcerer: Probably reduce the number of bonus feats. If he commits to metamagic+reducers and specialization then he's a powerhouse offensive engine at 6th level. NERF

ThiefAcrobat: This is a weird fucking class, I'm going to specify that you can't flank with yourself unless you're using mercurial charge. I don't want people to just completely cheese by using spring attack to get a sneak attack every round while moving out of range.
After that change I think it's an IMPROVE?
Really not sure, this seems weak compared to a rogue or jester. Probably should make this better somehow.

Wizard: Basically the same as sorcerer, but you're trading ammo for flexibility. NERF.

Paladin: Essentially the same as blackguard
