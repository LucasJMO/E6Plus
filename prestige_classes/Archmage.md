## Requirements

To qualify to become a hierophant, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Feats**: Magical Aptitude, Skill Focus (Knowledge [Arcana])

**Spells**: Able to cast 2nd-level arcane spells

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spells per Day
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | --------------
1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 2 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
2   | 1   | 0 | 0 | 3 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
3   | 1   | 1 | 1 | 3 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Archmages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known**: When a new archmage level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.

## High Arcana

An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description.

An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana.
