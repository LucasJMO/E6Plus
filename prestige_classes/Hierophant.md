## Requirements

To qualify to become a hierophant, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Feats**: A hierophant must have two out of Skill Focus (Knowledge [Religion]), Scribe Scroll, and Brew Potion

**Spells**: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spells per Day
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | --------------
1   | 0   | 2 | 0 | 2 | Special Ability | -
2   | 1   | 3 | 0 | 3 | Special Ability | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
3   | 1   | 3 | 1 | 3 | Special Ability | +1 level of existing spellcasting class

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Hierophants gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: From 2nd level on, when a new hierophant level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of hierophant to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a hierophant, she must decide to which class she adds each level of hierophant for the purpose of determining spells per day.

## Special Ability

**Absorb Damage**(Su): As a standard action you can transfer damage from touched allies to yourself. Healing them and damaging yourself for the same amount. If the damage sustained from using this ability would put you at 0 or fewer hit points you are automatically conscious and stable. Should you go to -10 however you will still die.

Damage sustained from using this ability bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage.

**Blast Infidel**(Su): A hierophant can use negative energy spells to their maximum effect on creatures with an alignment opposed to the hierophant. (See the table below for a list of which alignments are opposed to each alignment.) Any spell with a description that involves inflicting or channeling negative energy cast on a creature of the opposed alignment works as if under the effect of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot). Undead affected by this ability heal the maximized amount of damage. 

Hierophant Alignment | Opposed Alignment
-------------------- | -----------------
Lawful good     |Chaotic evil
Neutral good    |Neutral evil
Chaotic good    |Lawful evil 
Lawful neutral  |Chaotic neutral
Neutral         |Select one of lawful good, chaotic good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or neutral 
Chaotic neutral |Lawful neutral

Chaotic evil    |Lawful good

**Bless Water**(Su): You gain the ability to create temporary potions. Once per day per class level you may select one spell you know and imbue a vial of water with its benefits. The spell must be a valid choice for the Brew Potion feat. The vial of water becomes a potion of the selected spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 12 hours.

**Divine Counterspell**(Su): As an immediate action, you can expend one of your spells to counter a spell. Upon using this ability you must identify the spell with a spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level). If you correctly identify the spell you can expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the spell being cast to counter the spell. This ability is usable once per day per class level.

**Divine Reach**(Su): You can use touch spells on targets up to 30 feet away. If the spell requires a melee touch attack, the hierophant must make a ranged touch attack instead. Divine reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet.

**Faith Healing**(Su): A hierophant can use healing spells to their maximum effect on creatures of the same alignment as the hierophant (including the hierophant himself). Any spell with the healing descriptor cast on such creatures works as if under the effects of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot).

**Gift of the Divine**(Su): Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to transfer one or more uses of his turn undead ability to a willing creature. (Hierophants who rebuke undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the hierophant is reduced by the number transferred. The recipient turns undead as a cleric of the hierophant’s cleric level but uses her own Charisma modifier.

**Healing Overflow**(Su): When you use a spell to heal a creature's hit points, you may also heal another ally within 30 feet. This functions as if both allies were targeted by the ability, though it still only expends one use.

**Holy Strength**(Su): When you heal a creature with positive energy (such as by channeling positive energy to heal the living, using cure spells, or using lay on hands), any affected creature gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. If you channel negative energy to heal undead, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.

**Master of Energy**(Su): Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to channel positive or negative energy much more effectively, increasing his ability to affect undead. Add a +4 bonus to the hierophant’s turning checks and turning damage rolls. This ability only affects undead, even if the hierophant can turn other creatures, such as with a granted power of a domain.

**Metamagic Feat**: A hierophant can choose a metamagic feat in place of one of the special abilities described here if desired.

**Power of Nature**(Su): Available only to hierophants with druid levels, this ability allows a hierophant to temporarily transfer one or more of his druid Class Features to a willing creature. The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the hierophant cannot use the transferred power. He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to have an animal companion.

The druid’s wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. The heirophant choses how many uses of wild shape per day to give to transfer and retains the rest of the uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well.

As with the imbue with spell ability spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to which the recipient puts the transferred abilities.

**Spell-Like Ability**: A hierophant who selects this special ability can permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be cast sponteneously (this functions like the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast 'Cure' spells). The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP.

If the hierophant desires, he may attach a known metamagic feat to the selected spell, permanently raising the level of the spell-like ability. This ability may be selected more than once as a special ability, each time applying to a different spell.

**Spell Power**: This special ability increases a hierophant’s effective caster level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks.
