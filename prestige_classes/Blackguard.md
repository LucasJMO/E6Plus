**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.

**Spells**: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a blackguard with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Blackguard bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard’s Charisma modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The blackguard’s spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells).

**Aura of Evil**(Ex): The power of a blackguard's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.

**Detect Good**(Su): At will, a blackguard can use detect good as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the detect good spell.

**Poison Use**: Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.

**Smite Good**(Su): Once a day per class level, a blackguard may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack.

He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

**Dark Blessing**: A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.

**Command Undead**(Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.

**Aura of Despair**(Su): Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws.

**Sneak Attack**: This ability, gained at 3rd level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. 

## Fiendish Mount

Upon or after reaching 3rd level, a blackguard gains the ability to summon an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium blackguard) or a warpony (for a Small blackguard). A blackguard's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects the depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

The summoning ritual requires an hour of unbroken meditation. Once summoned the mount is treated as a normal magical beast (it must be fed/rested), and remains until it drops to 0 hit points or is dismissed (dismissal is a free action), a mount that is killed or dismissed leaves behind no physical form. In either case repeating the ritual summons the same mount, restored to its hit point maximum.

## Blackguard Spell List

Level | Spells Known
----- | ------------
**1** | Cause fear, corrupt weapon, cure light wounds, doom, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, summon monster 1 
**2** | bull’s strength, cure moderate wounds, darkness, death knell, eagle’s splendor, inflict moderate wounds, shatter, summon monster 2

**The Blackguard's Mount**:

Bonus HD | Natural Armor Adjustment| Strength Adjustment | Intelligence | Special
-------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------
+2       | +4                      | +1                  | 6            | Empathic Link, Improved Evasion, Share Spells, Share Saving Throws

**Bonus HD**: Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount’s base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount’s base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount’s HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster’s Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Adjustment**: An improvement to the mount’s existing natural armor bonus.

**Strength Adjustment**: Add this figure to the mount's strength score.

**Intelligence**: The mount's Intelligence score.

**Empathic Link**(Su): The blackguard has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The blackguard cannot see through the mount’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically.

**Improved Evasion**: When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

**Share Spells**: At the blackguard’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.

The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the blackguard before the duration expires. Additionally, the blackguard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A blackguard and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount’s type (magical beast).

**Share Saving Throws**: For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the blackguard’s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.
