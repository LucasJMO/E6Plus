**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.

**Spells**: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a blackguard with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Blackguard bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard’s Charisma modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The blackguard’s spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells).

**Aura of Evil**(Ex): The power of a blackguard's aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.

**Detect Good**(Su): At will, a blackguard can use detect good as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the detect good spell.

**Poison Use**: Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.

**Smite Good**(Su): Once a day per class level, a blackguard may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack.

He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

**Dark Blessing**: A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.

**Command Undead**(Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.

**Aura of Despair**(Su): Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws.

**Sneak Attack**: This ability, gained at 3rd level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. 

## Fiendish Servant

Upon or after reaching 3rd level, a blackguard can call a fiendish bat, cat, dire rat, horse, pony, raven, or toad to serve him. The blackguard’s servant further gains +2 HD, +1 natural armor, +1 strength, empathic link, improved evasion, share saving throws, share spells, and an Int score of 6.

A blackguard may have only one fiendish servant at a time.

Should the blackguard’s servant die, he may call for another one after a year and a day. The new fiendish servant has all the accumulated abilities due a servant of the blackguard’s current level.

**Empathic Link**(Su): The blackguard has an empathic link with his servant out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The blackguard cannot see through the servant’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.

Because of the empathic link between the servant and the blackguard, the blackguard has the same connection to a place or an item that the servant does.

**Improved Evasion**(Ex): If the servant is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage on a successful saving throw and only half damage on a failed saving throw. Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability.

**Share Saving Throws**: For each of its saving throws, the servant uses either its own base save bonus or the blackguard’s, whichever is higher. The servant applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any other bonuses on saves that the blackguard might have.

**Share Spells**: At the blackguard’s option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his servant. The servant must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the servant if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the servant again even if the servant returns to the blackguard before the duration expires. Additionally, the blackguard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his servant (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A blackguard and his servant can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the servant’s type (magical beast).
