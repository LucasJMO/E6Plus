## Requirements

To qualify to become a dragon disciple, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Race**: Any nondragon (cannot already be half-dragon).

**Spellcasting**: Ability to cast 1st level arcane spells without preparation

**Special**: The player chooses a dragon variety when taking the first level of this prestige class. Taken dragon disciple levels cannot be retrained. Dragon disciple levels stack with sorcerer levels for the purpose of determining caster level.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spellcasting
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | ------------
1   | 1   | 2 | 0 | 2 | Breath weapon (1d8), natural armor increase (+1) | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
2   | 2   | 3 | 0 | 3 | Ability boost (Str +2), bonus feat, claws and bite | -
3   | 3   | 3 | 1 | 3 | Ability boost (Dex +2), breath weapon (2d8), blindsense 30 ft, natural armor increase (+2) | +1 level of existing spellcasting class      
4   | 4   | 4 | 1 | 4 | Ability boost (Con +2), bonus feat | -         
5	| 5	  | 4 | 2 | 4 | Ability boost (Cha +2), Breath Weapon (3d8), draconic aspect, natural armor increase (+3) | +1 level of existing spellcasting class

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A dragon disciple is proficient with light armor.

**Spells per Day**: When a dragon disciple reaches levels 3 and 5, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an dragon disciple, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

A dragon disciple can cast spontaneous arcane spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.

**Natural Armor Increase**: At 1st, 3rd, and 5th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the character’s existing natural armor (if any). As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor’s physical aspect.

**Ability Boost**(Ex): As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, his ability scores increase.

These increases stack and are gained as if through level advancement.

**Breath Weapon**(Su): At 1st level, a dragon disciple gains a minor breath weapon. The type and shape depend on the dragon variety whose heritage he enjoys (see below). Regardless of the ancestor, the breath weapon deals 1d8 points of damage of the appropriate energy type. At 3rd level the damage increases to 2d8, and at 5th level it increases to 3d8.

Regardless of its strength, the breath weapon can be used only once every 1d4 rounds. Use all the rules for dragon breath weapons except as specified here.

The DC of the breath weapon is 10 + character level.

A line-shaped breath weapon is 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 60 feet long. A cone-shaped breath weapon is 30 feet long.

Dragon Variety | Breath Weapon 
-------------- | -------------
Black | Line of acid
Blue  | Line of lightning
Green | Cone of corrosive gas (acid)
Red   | Cone of fire
White | Cone of cold
Brass | Line of fire
Bronze| Line of lightning
Copper| Line of acid
Gold  | Cone of fire
Silver| Cone of cold

**Bonus Metamagic Feat**: At 2nd and 4th level a Dragon Disciple may select a bonus metabreath feat for which it meets the prerequisites.

**Claws and Bite**(Ex): At 2nd level, a dragon disciple gains claw and bite attacks if he does not already have them. Use the values below or the disciple’s base claw and bite damage values, whichever are greater.

A dragon disciple is considered proficient with these attacks. When making a full attack, a dragon disciple uses his full base attack bonus with his bite attack but takes a -5 penalty on claw attacks. The Multiattack feat reduces this penalty to only -2.

Size | Bite Damage | Claw Damage 
---- | ----------- | -----------
Small| 1d4 | 1d3
Medium | 1d6 | 1d4
Large | 1d8 | 1d6

**Blindsense**(Ex): At 3rd level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things it cannot see. He usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature.

Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

**Draconic Aspect**: A 5th level dragon disciple's appearance is forever altered, their skin gains a smooth, metallic quality, and a light tinge matching the color of their chosen dragon variety. Their eyes change to a deep golden color. 

They gain a +2 to charisma based skill checks, +1 to saves against paralysis, sleep, or poison, darkvision out to 60 feet (120 feet if they already had darkvision from another source), and damage reduction 1/magic.
