## Requirements

To qualify to become a loremaster, a character must meet the following requirements.

**Skills**: Knowledge, any, 6 ranks.

**Feats**: Any two Skill Focus (Knowledge [any individual Knowledge skill]) feats.

**Spells**: Must be able to cast a first level divination spell.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spellcasting
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | ------------
1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 2 | Bonus Languages, Secret| +1 level of existing spellcasting class 
2   | 1   | 0 | 0 | 3 | Secret| +1 level of existing spellcasting class
3   | 1   | 1 | 1 | 3 | Lore, secret | +1 level of existing spellcasting class      

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Loremasters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: When a loremaster advances in level, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Bonus Languages**: Each time a loremaster gains a level, he can choose any new language.

**Secret**: When a loremaster advances in level he chooses one secret from the table below. He can't choose the same secret twice.

Secret | Effect
------ | ------
Instant Mastery | 4 ranks of a skill in which the character has no ranks
Secret Health | +3 hit points
Secrets of inner strength | +2 bonus on Will saves
The lore of true stamina | +2 bonus on Fortitude saves
Secret knowledge of avoidance | +2 bonus on Reflex saves
Weapon trick | +1 bonus on attack rolls
Dodge trick | +1 dodge bonus to AC
Newfound arcana | 1 bonus 1st-level spell
More newfound arcana | 1 bonus 2nd-level spell

**Lore**: At 3rd level, a loremaster gains the ability to know legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. The loremaster adds her level, her Intelligence modifier, and her ranks in knowledge (history) divided by two to the lore check, which functions otherwise exactly like a bardic knowledge check.

DC | Type of Knowledge
-- | -----------------
10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population.
20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.
25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.
