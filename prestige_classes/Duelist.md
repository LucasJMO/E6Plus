## Requirements

To qualify to become a duelist, a character must have a base attack bonus of +3 or greater.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- 
1   | 1   | 2 | 2 | 0 | Canny defense, improved reaction, enhanced mobility
2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 0 | Clever opportunist, combat reflexes, grace, spring attack
3   | 3   | 3 | 3 | 1 | Deflect attacks, precise strike +1d6

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no type of armor or shield.

**Canny Defense**(Ex): When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist gains a dodge bonus to AC equal to 1 + class level.

If a duelist is caught flat footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.

**Improved Reaction**(Ex): A duelist gains a +1 untyped initiative bonus per class level, up to a maximum of +3 at 3rd level. This stacks with the bonus from the Improved Initiative feat.

**Enhanced Mobility**(Ex): When wearing no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square.

**Clever Opportunist**(Ex): While making attacks of opportunity, a 2nd level duelist adds an untyped +1 bonus to her attack and damage rolls for each class level.

**Combat Reflexes**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains combat reflexes as a bonus feat.

**Grace**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.

**Spring Attack**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains spring attack as a bonus feat. Even if she does not meet the prerequisites for this feat.

**Deflect Attacks**: At 3rd level, a duelist gainst the ability to deflect incoming attacks. A duelist who would be struck by an attack may expend an immediate action in order to roll an opposed attack. If the result of the duelist's attack roll is equal to or higher than the opponent's attack roll, the attack deals no damage and causes no secondary effects. A duelist may only use this ability while she is not wearing armor or using a shield.

**Precise Strike**(Ex): At 3rd level, a duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed weapon, gaining an extra 1d6 damage added to her normal damage roll.

When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from a precise strike.
