## Requirements

To qualify to become a duelist, a character must have a base attack bonus of +3 or greater.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- 
1   | 1   | 2 | 2 | 0 | Canny defense, improved reaction +2, spring attack
2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 0 | Clever opportunist, combat reflexes, deflect attacks, grace
3   | 3   | 3 | 3 | 1 | Skirmish +1d6, improved reaction +4

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no type of armor or shield.

**Canny Defense**(Ex): When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist adds a +1 dodge bonus to AC per class level. If a duelist is caught flat footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.

**Improved Reaction**(Ex): A duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. At 3rd level this bonus increases to +4. This stacks with the bonus from the Improved Initiative feat.

**Spring Attack**(Ex): A 1st level duelist gains spring attack as a bonus feat. Even if she does not meet the prerequisites for this feat.

**Clever Opportunist**(Ex): While making attacks of opportunity, a 2nd level duelist adds an untyped +1 bonus to her attack and damage rolls for each class level.

**Combat Reflexes**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains combat reflexes as a bonus feat.

**Deflect Attacks**: At 2nd level, a duelist gainst the ability to deflect incoming attacks. A duelist who would be struck by an attack may expend an immediate action in order to roll an opposed attack. If the result of the duelist's attack roll is equal to or higher than the opponent's attack roll, the attack deals no damage and causes no secondary effects. A duelist may only use this ability while she is not wearing armor or using a shield.

**Grace**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.

**Skirmish**(Ex): A 3rd level duelist deals an extra 1d6 damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. Because skirmish relies on nimble movement, a duelist does not gain these bonuses on any turn during which she charges.
