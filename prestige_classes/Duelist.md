## Requirements

To qualify to become a duelist, a character must have a base attack bonus of +3 or greater.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- 
1   | 1   | 2 | 2 | 0 | Canny defense, improved reaction +2, spring attack
2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 0 | Clever opportunist, combat reflexes, deflect arrows, grace
3   | 3   | 3 | 3 | 1 | Skirmish +1d6, improved reaction +4

**Canny Defense**(Ex): When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist adds a +1 dodge bonus to AC per class level. If a duelist is caught flat footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.

**Improved Reaction**(Ex): A duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. At 3rd level this bonus increases to +4. This stacks with the bonus from the Improved Initiative feat.

**Spring Attack**(Ex): A 1st level duelist gains spring attack as a bonus feat. Even if she does not meet the prerequisites for this feat.

**Clever Opportunist**(Ex): While making attacks of opportunity, a 2nd level duelist adds an untyped +1 bonus to her attack and damage rolls for each class level.

**Combat Reflexes**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains combat reflexes as a bonus feat.

**Deflect Arrows**: At 2nd level, a duelist gainst the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat.

**Grace**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.

**Skirmish**(Ex): A 3rd level duelist deals an extra 1d6 damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. Because skirmish relies on nimble movement, a duelist does not gain these bonuses on any turn during which she charges.
