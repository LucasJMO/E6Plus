**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: When an Eldritch Knight gains a level the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an Eldritch Knight, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Armored Caster**: A 1st level Eldritch Knight gains the ability to reduce her arcane spell failure chance by 5%. At each subsequent Eldritch Knight level this ability increases by 5%, up to 25% at 5th level.

**Martial Weapon Proficiency**: A 1st level Eldritch Knight gains the feat Martial Weapon Proficiency.

**Armor Proficiency (Light)**: A 2nd level Eldritch Knight gains the feat Armor Proficiency (Light)

**Armor Proficiency (Medium)**: A 3rd level Eldritch Knight gains the feat Armor Proficiency (Medium).

**Armor Proficiency (Heavy)**: A 3rd level Eldritch Knight gains the feat Armor Proficiency (Heavy).

**Bonus Feat**: At 6th level an Eldritch Knight gains a bonus feat. She can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The Eldritch Knight must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.
