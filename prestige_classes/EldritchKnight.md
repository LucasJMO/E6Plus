4   | 4   | 4 | 1 | 4 |  | -         
5	| 5	  | 4 | 2 | 4 |  | +1 level of existing spellcasting class

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: When an eldritch knight reaches levels 3 and 5, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an eldritch knight, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.
