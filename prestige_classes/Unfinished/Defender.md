# Defender

**Hit Die**: d12

**Skills**: Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis)

**Skills/Level**: 2 + Int modifier

## Requirements

To qualify to become a defender, a character must have a base attack bonus of +3 or greater.

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | AC Bonus | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | -------- | -------
1   | 1   | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | Defensive stance, uncanny dodge
2   | 2   | 3 | 0 | 3 | 2 | Grounding strike, draw fire, sacrifice
3   | 3   | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 | Damage reduction 3/-, improved uncanny dodge

**AC Bonus**: A defender receives a dodge bonus to Armor Class that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +3 at 3rd level.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A defender is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields.

**Defensive Stance**: When he adopts a defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he may take no movement on his turn except for a single 5-foot step. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, a +4 dodge bonus to AC, and a +2 bonus to damage reduction.

Using or stopping the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. A defender suffers no penalties for exiting his stance, but he may only re-enter it after taking no physical actions for a full minute.

**Uncanny Dodge**(Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

**Grounding Strike**(Ex): If a defender strikes an opponent with an attack of opportunity, he may choose to stop the opponent's movement. Forcing them to remain in their current space until their next turn.

**Draw Fire**: With a Swift Action, a defender may pique the interest of any opponent with intelligence 6 or less within medium range. That creature must make a will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier) or spend all of its actions moving towards or attacking the defender. This effect ends after a number of rounds equal to the defenderâ€™s class level.

**Sacrifice**: As an immediate action a defender may make herself the target of an attack or target effect that targets any creature within her reach.

**Damage Reduction**(Ex): At 3rd level, a defender gains damage reduction. Subtract 3 points from the damage the defender takes each time he is dealt damage.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge**(Ex): At 3rd level, a defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the defender.

If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
