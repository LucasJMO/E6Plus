**Skills/Level**: 2 + Int modifier

## Requirements

To qualify to become an archmage, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Feats**: Magical Aptitude, Skill Focus (Knowledge [Arcana])

**Spells**: Able to cast 2nd-level arcane spells

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spells per Day
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | --------------
1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 2 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
2   | 1   | 0 | 0 | 3 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
3   | 1   | 1 | 1 | 3 | High Arcana | +1 level of existing spellcasting class

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Archmages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known**: When a new archmage level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 2nd-level spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 2nd-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.

## High Arcana

An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one spell slot. She may eliminate a higher spell slot than she can cast, however she does not gain access to the selected high arcana until she reaches a level which would allow her to cast a spell of the required level. Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description.

An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana. 

## 0th Level High Arcana

**Altered Form**(Su): You gain the ability to cast alter self as a 0th level spell. All other parts of the spell remain unchanged, and for the purpose of dispel checks it is still treated as 2nd level.

**Enduring Shield**(Su): You gain the ability to manifest an invisible disk of force in front of you, granting a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. You may manifest or dismiss this disk as a free action, there is no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance for having it active.

## 1st Level High Arcana

**Arcane Reach**(Su): You may use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. If the spell requires a touch attack you must make a ranged touch attack instead. You may select this ability a second time, in which case the range increases to 60 feet.

**Energy Resistance**(Su): You gain resistance 10 to an energy type of your choice.

**Mastery of Shaping**: When casting spells with an area of effect, you may select any number of 5 foot squares within the spell's area which are not subject to the spell.

**Spell Power**: You increase your effective caster level by 1 for the purposes of determining level dependent spell variables and for caster level checks. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective cast level are cumulative.

**Studied Caster**(Ex): You automatically identify any arcane spell cast within 60 feet of you if it's on your class' spell list and you're of a high enough level to cast it. Whenever you attempt to identify a non-artifact magic item using detect magic, you automatically learn its properties and command words in the first round of the spell (no Spellcraft roll needed), but you can't automatically determine whether it's cursed.

## 2nd Level High Arcana

**Enhanced Duration**(Ex): Treat your caster level as 6 higher when determining the duration of spells you cast. This doesn't alter any other variable effects of the spell.

**Instant Counterspell**(Su): As an immediate action, you can expend one of your spells to counter a spell. Upon using this ability you must identify the spell with a spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level). If you correctly identify the spell you can expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the spell being cast to counter the spell. This ability is usable once per day per class level.

**Perfect Concentration**(Ex): You automatically succeed at concentration checks to cast arcane spells. 

## 3rd Level High Arcana

**Arcane Blast**(Su): You may expend a spell to fire a ray of force dealing 1d6 per class level + 1d6 per level of spell expended. This ray has a range of 10 feet per level, requires a standard action to fire and a ranged touch attack to hit.

**Quickened Arcane Blast**(Su): The arcane blast ability requires a swift action to use instead of a standard action.

## Variable Level High Arcana

**Enhanced Knowledge**(Ex): You learn a number of new spells with levels totalling to the level of the lost spell slot + 1. Treat 0th level spells as 1/2. 

**Enhanced Stamina**(Ex): You gain a number of new spell slots with levels totalling to the level of the lost spell slot + 2. Treat 0th level spells as 1/2.

**Spell-Like Ability**: You can permanently prepare one of your spells as a spell-like ability that can be cast sponteneously (this functions like the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast 'Cure' spells). The Archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP.

If you desire, you may attach a known metamagic feat to the selected spell, permanently raising the level of the spell-like ability. This ability may be selected more than once as a special ability, each time applying to a different spell.

This high arcana costs a spell slot equal to the level of the selected spell-like ability.
