LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- 
1   | 1   | 2 | 2 | 0 | Canny defense, combat reflexes, duelist strike, improved reaction
2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 0 | Clever opportunist, deflect attacks, grace, spring attack

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no type of armor or shield.

**Canny Defense**(Ex): When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist gains a dodge bonus to AC equal to 2 + class level.

If a duelist is caught flat footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.

**Combat Reflexes**(Ex): A duelist gains combat reflexes as a bonus feat.

**Duelist Strike**: Any time a Duelist makes a single melee attack with a light or one-handed weapon, for each duelist level he adds +1 to his attack roll and deals an additional 1d6 damage. These bonuses only apply when the duelist is not wearing any armor or using a shield. This bonus does not apply when the duelist makes a full round attack.

**Improved Reaction**(Ex): A duelist gains a +1 untyped initiative bonus per class level, up to a maximum of +2 at 2nd level. This stacks with the bonus from the Improved Initiative feat.

**Clever Opportunist**(Ex): While making attacks of opportunity, a 2nd level duelist adds an untyped +1 bonus to her attack and damage rolls for each class level.

**Deflect Attacks**: At 2nd level, a duelist gainst the ability to deflect incoming attacks. A duelist who would be struck by an attack may expend an immediate action in order to roll an opposed attack. If the result of the duelist's attack roll is equal to or higher than the opponent's attack roll, the attack deals no damage and causes no secondary effects. A duelist may only use this ability while she is not wearing armor or using a shield.


**Grace**(Ex): A 2nd level duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.

**Spring Attack**: At 2nd level a duelist gains the feat Spring Attack.
