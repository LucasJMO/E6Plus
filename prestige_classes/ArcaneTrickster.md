## Requirements

To qualify to become an arcane trickster, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.

**Skills**: Spellcraft 6 ranks

**Spells**: Able to cast 1st level arcane spells.

**Special**: Sneak attack +1d6

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spellcasting
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | ------------
1   | 0   | 0 | 2 | 2 | Ranged legerdemain | +1 level of existing spellcasting class 
2   | 1   | 0 | 3 | 3 | Sneak attack +1d6 | +1 level of existing spellcasting class
3   | 1   | 1 | 3 | 3 | Impromptu sneak attack | +1 level of existing spellcasting class   

**Ranged Legerdemain**: An arcane trickster can perform the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less.

**Sneak Attack**: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. If the arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source the bonuses on damage stack.

**Impromptu Sneak Attack**: Once per day a third level arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack).
