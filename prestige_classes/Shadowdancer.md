**Hide in Plain Sight**(Su): A 1st level shadowdancer can use the Hide skill even while being observed (as long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow). He cannot however, hide in his own shadow. 

**Shadow Illusion**(Sp): When a shadowdancer reaches 2nd level, she can create visual illusions. This abilityâ€™s effect is identical to that of the arcane spell silent image and may be employed at will. The save to disbelieve is 10 + 1/2 shadowdancer levels + the shadowdancer's Charisma modifier.

**Evasion**(Ex):At 2nd level and higher, a shadowdancer can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless shadowdancer does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Darkvision**(Su): A 2nd level shadowdancer gains darkvision out to 60-feet, or 120-foot darkvision if he already had darkvision from another source.

**Shadow Jump**(Su): At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. The max distance a shadowdancer can jump begins at 20 ft., and doubles every two class levels, up to 80 ft. at level 6.

Making a jump requires a standard action, and can only be used once every 1d6 rounds.

**Uncanny Dodge**(Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a shadowdancer retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

**Cloak of Shadow**(Su): A shadowdancer in darkness gains 

**Summon Shadow**(Su):

**Improved Uncanny Dodge**(Ex): At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her).

If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
