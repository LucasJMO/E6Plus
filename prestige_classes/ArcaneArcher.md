LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special 
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- 
1   | 1   | 2 | 2 | 0 | Enhance arrow, imbue arrow
2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 0 | Seeker Arrow
3   | 3   | 3 | 3 | 1 | Hail of arrows

**Enhance Arrow**(Su): Nonmagical arrows fired by an arcane archer become magical and gain a +1 enhancement bonus per class level. An archer's magic arrows only function for her. 

**Imbue Arrow**(Sp): At 1st level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell’s area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow’s range rather than the spell’s range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.

**Seeker Arrow**(Sp): At 2nd level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow six times per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow’s range prevents the arrow’s flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).

**Hail of Arrows**(Sp): As a standard action, 6 times per day a 3rd level arcane archer can fire arrows at up to 3 separate targets within range. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.
