## Requirements

To qualify to become an Arcane Archer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Feats**: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot

**Spells**: Ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells

LVL | BAB | F | R | W | Special | Spellcasting
--- | --- | - | - | - | ------- | ------------
1   | 1   | 0 | 2 | 2 | Enhance Arrow, Imbue Arrow | +1 Level of Existing Spellcasting Class
2   | 2   | 0 | 3 | 3 | Bonus Feat, Seeker Arrow | +1 Level of Existing Spellcasting Class
3   | 3   | 1 | 3 | 3 | Hail of Arrows, Phase Arrow | +1 Level of Existing Spellcasting Class  

**Spells per Day**: When an Arcane Archer gains a level the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Enhance Arrow**(Su): Nonmagical arrows fired by an Arcane Archer become magical and gain a +1 enhancement bonus per class level. An archer's magic arrows only function for her. 

**Imbue Arrow**(Sp): At 1st level, an Arcane Archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell’s area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow’s range rather than the spell’s range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.

**Bonus Feat**: A 2nd level Arcane Archer may select a bonus feat which he meets the prerequisites for.

**Seeker Arrow**(Sp): At 2nd level, an Arcane Archer can launch an arrow six times per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow’s range prevents the arrow’s flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).

**Empower Arrow**: At 3rd level, an Arcane Archer gains the ability to place a spell with range touch upon an arrow. If the arrow connects with its target, it deals damage normally and delivers the effect of the spell. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.

**Hail of Arrows**(Sp): As a standard action, 6 times per day a 3rd level Arcane Archer can fire arrows at up to 3 separate targets within range. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.

**Phase Arrow**(Sp): At 6th level, an Arcane Archer can launch an arrow once per day per class level at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.
