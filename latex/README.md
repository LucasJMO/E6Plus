The tex files in classes/ and prestige_classes/ are autogenerated from the md files using md2tex.py, that said it's very hacky and they're all pretty ugly.

If you want to regenerate the tex files to reflect changes to the md, go a directory up and enter 'python md2tex.py', if you then want to regenerate the pdf go back into this directory and enter 'pdflatex E6+.tex'
