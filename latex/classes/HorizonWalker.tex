\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: A horizon walker is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Horizon walkers are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

\textbf{Terrain Mastery}: At each level, the Horizon Walker adds a new terrain environment to their repertoire from those given below. Terrain mastery gives a horizon walker a bonus on checks involving a skill useful in that terrain, or some other appropriate benefit. A horizon walker also knows how to fight dangerous creatures typically found in that terrain, gaining a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures with that terrain mentioned in the Environment entry of their descriptions. The horizon walker only gains the bonus if the creature description specifically lists the terrain type.

Horizon walkers take their terrain mastery with them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses on skill checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls whether theyâ€™re actually in the relevant terrain or not.

\textbf{Planar Attunement(Su)}: A 4th level horizon walker gains the ability to attune himself to a plane, gaining the benefits of terrain mastery for that plane. At 5th, and each level thereafter, he may select an additional plane to be simultaneously attuned to (up to 3 at 6th level).

A horizon walker can change the planes he is attuned to by spending a week in careful meditation. He must full rest each night, and spend 12 hours each day connecting to the planes he wishes to attune himself to. He may use the remaining hours of the day to engage in simple, non-strenuous activity. Combat or use of his horizon step ability will cause the attempt to fail, leaving him attuned to the same planes as he was before attempting to change.

\textbf{Horizon Step(Su)}: A 5th level horizon walker gains the ability to teleport a short distance every 1d4 rounds. Using this ability requires a swift action, the max range traveled is 60 feet, you must have line of sight to the desired destination, and if this ability would put you in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, it fails. This form of movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and is only available to a horizon walker wearing light, medium, or no armor.

The horizon walker may bring touched objects, so long as their weight does not exceed his maximum load. He cannot however bring other creatures.

\textbf{Horizon Guide(Su)}: A 6th level horizon walker may expend a standard action to allow himself and up to three allies within 60 feet to teleport a short distance. This teleportation functions like horizon step. This ability is usable up to three times per day, using it does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
