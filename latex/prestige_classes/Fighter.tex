\textbf{Bonus Feats}: At 1st and 2nd level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to any other feats from his race or level progression. These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.
