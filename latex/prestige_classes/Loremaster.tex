\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Loremasters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

\textbf{Spells per Day}: When a loremaster advances in level, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

\textbf{Bonus Languages}: Each time a loremaster gains a level, he can choose any new language.

\textbf{Secret}: When a loremaster advances in level he chooses one secret from the table below. He can't choose the same secret twice.

\textbf{Lore}: At 3rd level, a loremaster gains the ability to know legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. The loremaster adds her level, her Intelligence modifier, and her ranks in knowledge (history) divided by two to the lore check, which functions otherwise exactly like a bardic knowledge check.

25 &Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. \\
30 &\makecell{Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it,\\ possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.} \\
