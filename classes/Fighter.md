**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to any feats from their normal level progression.

**Combat Focus**(Ex): If the fighter is in a situation that is stressful and/or dangerous enough that he would normally be unable to take 10 on skill checks, he may spend a swift action to gain combat focus. A fighter may end his combat focus at any time to reroll any die roll he makes, and if not used it ends on its own after a number of rounds equal to his class level. After voluntarily ending combat focus he must wait one round before re-entering it.

**Active Assault**(Ex): A 2nd level fighter gains the ability to take a 5 foot step each turn as an immediate action, this is in addition to all other forms of movement (including the normal 5 foot step).

**Problem Solver**(Ex): A 3rd level fighter may expend a swift action and gain the benefits of any [Combat] feat for which he meets the prerequisites and use it for a number of rounds equal to his class level. This ability may be used once per hour.

**Weapon Training**(Ex): A 4th level fighter gains the ability to become proficient with any weapon he spends a full day training with. He may take no other actions during this day, and if he is interrupted he loses all progress and must begin again.

**Improved Delay**(Ex): A 5th level fighter may delay his actions in one round without compromising his initiative in the next round. In addition, a fighter may interrupt another action with his delayed action like it was a readied action (though he does not have to announce his intentions beforehand).

**Foil Action**(Ex): A 6th level fighter may use an immediate action to make a touch attack or ranged touch attack on any opponent within 30 ft. If this attack succeeds the opponent's action is wasted, and any spell slots, limited ability uses, or the like used to power it are expended.
