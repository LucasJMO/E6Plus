**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell being cast has a somatic component. A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

**Spells**: A bard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it beforehand. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every Bard level after that, a Bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. 

**Bardic Knowledge**: A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to bard level + intelligence modifier + ranks in knowledge (history) divided by two. A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item, byt may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or 20 on this check.

DC | Type of Knowledge
-- | -----------------
10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population.
20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.
25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.

**Skill Focus (Perform)**: At 1st level a bard gains the feat skill focus for the skill perform. If the Bard already has this feat, they can instead select a different feat for which they meet the prerequisites.

**Bardic Music**(Su): A 1st level bard gains the ability to aid allies with his music. This can be used a number of times per day equal to bard class level. Inspire Heroism and Inspire Competence both exhaust one daily use of bardic music. 

**Inspire Heroism**(Su): At 1st level, a bard who is performing one of his song abilities can select an ally being affected by the song and provide them with a +1 morale bonus to saving throws, armor class, attack rolls, and damage. At 3rd level this bonus increases to +2, and at 5th level it increases to +3. This bonus continues as long as the ally is being affected by the bard's song, and for 5 rounds after.

**Inspire Competence**(Su): At 2nd level, a bard can help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet, and be able to see and hear the Bard. The ally gains a competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he continues to hear the bard's music. This bonus is equal to the bard's performance check divided by 5 (rounded down). The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of two minutes. A bard cannot inspire competence in himself.

**Songs**(Su): The bardic ablities song of life/shelter/evasion/freedom/battle/swiftness are supernatural abilities which confer bonuses on allies within 30 ft who can hear the bard. Each song requires a standard action to start, and a standard action each round to continue. There is no limit on the number of rounds a song can remain active. Stopping a song is a free action, and transitioning from one active song to another requires a swift action. If a bard takes damage while using a song they must roll a concentration check of DC 10 + damage dealt or stop any ongoing song effect.

**Song of Life**: Affected allies gain immunity to poison and disease. Additionally once per day per two class levels, a bard can roll a performance check and heal an affected ally a number of hitpoints equal to the result of the check.

**Song of Shelter**: Affected allies gain resistance 5 to an energy type of the bard's choosing. The bard may switch to a different type of energy by expending a swift action. At 5th level the resistance increases to 10.

**Song of Evasion**: Affected allies gain +2 to armor class and saving throws. Additionally a bard with song of evasion active gains concealment.

**Song of Freedom**: A bard may select an ally within range, granting them freedom of movement and suppressing an ongoing spell efect. If the ally exits range or the song ends, then the spell effect resumes.

**Song of Battle**: Affected allies gain +2 to attack rolls and damage.

**Song of Swiftness**: Affected allies who make a full attack gain an extra attack at their full base attack bonus. Additionally a bard with song of swiftness active increases all of their forms of movement (land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) by 30 feet, up to a maximum of twice the bard's normal speed with that form of movement.

**Combine Songs**: At 6th level, a bard gains the ability to have multiple songs active at the same time. Starting a combined song is a standard action, switching either active song is a swift action, and stopping is a free action. Two versions of the same song can be active, however their effects do not stack. The exceptions to this are song of shelter (the bard can choose a different type of energy for each song) and song of freedom (the bard can choose a separate target for each song, or suppress two ongoing spell effects on the same target). A bard with a combined song active must fully stop (end both songs) before entering a power song.

**Power Song**: A 6th level bard who elects not to start a combined song can instead start a power song. This functions identically to standard songs, however range is increased to 60 feet. A bard with a power song active must fully stop (end the song) before entering a combined song.
