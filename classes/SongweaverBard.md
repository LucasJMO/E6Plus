**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A songweaver is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. songweavers are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A songweaver can cast songweaver spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell being cast has a somatic component. A multiclass songweaver still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

**Spells**: A songweaver casts arcane spells which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it beforehand. To learn or cast a spell, a songweaver must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a songweaver's spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every songweaver level after that, a songweaver can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. 

**Bardic Knowledge**: A songweaver may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to songweaver level + intelligence modifier + ranks in knowledge (history) divided by two. A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item, byt may give a hint as to its general function. A songweaver may not take 10 or 20 on this check.

DC | Type of Knowledge
-- | -----------------
10 | Common, known by at least a substantial minority of the local population.
20 | Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.
25 | Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
30 | Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.

**Skill Focus (Perform)**: At 1st level a songweaver gains the feat skill focus for the skill perform. If the songweaver already has this feat, they can instead select a different feat for which they meet the prerequisites.

**Heroic Note**(Su): At 1st level, a songweaver who is performing one of his song abilities can select an ally being affected by the song and provide them with a +1 morale bonus to saving throws, armor class, attack rolls, and damage. At 3rd level this bonus increases to +2, and at 5th level it increases to +3. This bonus continues as long as the ally is being affected by the songweaver's song, and for 5 rounds after. This ability can be used once per songweaver level per day.

**Clever Melody**(Su): At 2nd level, a songweaver can help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet, and be able to see and hear the songweaver. The ally gains a competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he continues to hear the songweaver's music. This bonus is equal to the songweaver's performance check divided by 5 (rounded down). The effect lasts as long as the songweaver concentrates, up to a maximum of two minutes. A songweaver cannot inspire competence in himself. This ability can be used once per songweaver level per day.

**Songs**(Su): The ablities song of life/shelter/evasion/freedom/battle/swiftness are supernatural abilities which confer bonuses on allies within 30 ft who can hear the songweaver. Each song requires a standard action to start, and a standard action each round to continue. There is no limit on the number of rounds a song can remain active. Stopping a song is a free action, and transitioning from one active song to another requires a swift action. If a songweaver takes damage while using a song they must roll a concentration check of DC 10 + damage dealt or stop any ongoing song effect.

**Song of Life**: Affected allies gain immunity to poison and disease. Additionally once per day per two class levels, a songweaver can roll a performance check and heal an affected ally a number of hitpoints equal to the result of the check.

**Song of Shelter**: Affected allies gain resistance 5 to an energy type of the songweaver's choosing. The songweaver may switch to a different type of energy by expending a swift action. At 5th level the resistance increases to 10.

**Song of Evasion**: Affected allies gain +2 to armor class and saving throws. Additionally a songweaver with song of evasion active gains concealment.

**Song of Freedom**: A songweaver may select an ally within range, granting them freedom of movement and suppressing an ongoing spell efect. If the ally exits range or the song ends, then the spell effect resumes.

**Song of Battle**: Affected allies gain +2 to attack rolls and damage.

**Song of Swiftness**: Affected allies who make a full attack gain an extra attack at their full base attack bonus. Additionally a songweaver with song of swiftness active increases all of their forms of movement (land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) by 30 feet, up to a maximum of twice the songweaver's normal speed with that form of movement.

**Combine Songs**: At 6th level, a songweaver gains the ability to have multiple songs active at the same time. Starting a combined song is a standard action, switching either active song is a swift action, and stopping is a free action. Two versions of the same song can be active, however their effects do not stack. The exceptions to this are song of shelter (the songweaver can choose a different type of energy for each song) and song of freedom (the songweaver can choose a separate target for each song, or suppress two ongoing spell effects on the same target). A songweaver with a combined song active must fully stop (end both songs) before entering a power song.

**Power Song**: A 6th level songweaver who elects not to start a combined song can instead start a power song. This functions identically to standard songs, however range is increased to 60 feet. A songweaver with a power song active must fully stop (end the song) before entering a combined song.
