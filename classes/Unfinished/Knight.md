**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Knights are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Designate Opponent**: As a swift action, a Knight may mark an opponent as their primary foe. This foe must be within medium range and be able to hear the Knight’s challenge. If the target creature inflicts any damage on the Knight before the Knight’s next turn, the attempt fails. Otherwise, any attacks the Knight uses against the opponent during her next turn inflict an extra d6 of damage for each Knight level. This effect ends at the end of her next turn, or when she has struck her opponent a number of times equal to the number of attacks normally allotted by her Base Attack Bonus.

**Code of Conduct**: A knight must abide by the following rules. Breaking any results in the loss of Knightly abilities until atonement is completed. A knight must refuse bonuses from Aid Another actions in combat, a knight must refrain from the use of poisons of any kind, a knight may not voluntarily change shape, and a knight may not sell magic items.

**Draw Fire**: With a Swift Action, a Knight may pique the interest of any mindless opponent within medium range. That creature must make a will save (DC 10 + ½ HD + constitution modifier) or spend all of its actions moving towards or attacking the Knight. This effect ends after a number of rounds equal to the Knight’s class level.

**Damage Reduction**: A Knight has Damage Reduction X/-, where X is half her Knight level, rounded down.

**Bastion of Defense**: All adjacent allies except the Knight gain a +2 Dodge bonus to their AC and Reflex Saves.

**Energy Resistance**: As a swift action, a 3rd level Knight may grant herself Energy Resistance against any type of energy equal to her Knight Level plus her Shield Bonus. This energy resistance lasts until she spends a Swift Action to choose another Energy type, or her Shield Bonus is reduced.

**Spell Shield**: A Knight gains Spell Resistance of 5 plus her character level.

**Speak to Animals**: A Knight gains a bonus to her Ride and Handle Animal checks equal to half her Knight level.

**Immunity to Fear**: A Knight is immune to Fear effects.

**Knightly Spirit**: As a Move equivalent action, a 4th level Knight may restore any amount of attribute damage or drain that she has suffered.

**Sacrifice**: As an immediate action a Knight may make herself the target of an attack or target effect that targets any creature within her reach.

**Mettle**: A Knight who succeeds a Fortitude partial or Willpower partial save takes no effect as if she had immunity.

**Defend Others**: Any ally adjacent to the Knight gains Evasion, although the Knight does not.

**Quick Recovery**: If a Knight is stunned or dazed during her turn, that condition ends at the end of that turn.
