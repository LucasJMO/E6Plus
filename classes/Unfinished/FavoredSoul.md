**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Favored Souls are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).

A Favored Soul who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity’s weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

**Aura**(Ex): A Favored Soul of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Favored Souls who don’t worship a specific deity but choose the Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

**Spells**: A Favored Soul casts divine spells, which are drawn from the Favored Soul spell list. To prepare or cast a spell, a Favored Soul must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a Favored Soul’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the Favored Soul’s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a Favored Soul can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the above table. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A Favored Soul also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a Favored Soul prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).

Favored Souls meditate or pray for their spells. Each Favored Soul must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a Favored Soul can prepare spells. A Favored Soul may prepare and cast any spell on the Favored Soul spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

**Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells**: A Favored Soul’s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A Favored Soul chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A Favored Soul can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.

If a Favored Soul is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.

Each domain gives the Favored Soul access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The Favored Soul gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.

With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a Favored Soul prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the Favored Soul spell list, a Favored Soul can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A good Favored Soul (or a neutral Favored Soul of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the Favored Soul did not prepare ahead of time. The Favored Soul can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

An evil Favored Soul (or a neutral Favored Soul of an evil deity), can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name).

A Favored Soul who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the Favored Soul turns or commands undead.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A Favored Soul can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

**Metamagician**: Once per day per two class levels a Favored Soul can apply one of Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Maximize Spell, Quicken Spell, Silent Spell, or Widen Spell to a spell he casts without increasing the spell's level.

**Turn or Rebuke Undead**(Su): Any Favored Soul, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).

A good Favored Soul (or a neutral Favored Soul who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil Favored Soul (or a neutral Favored Soul who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral Favored Soul of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good Favored Soul or an evil Favored Soul. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the Favored Soul can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells.

A Favored Soul may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A Favored Soul with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

This bonus feat is in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The Favored Soul is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.

**Lay on Hands**: Beginning at 4th level, a Favored Soul gains the ability to heal wounds by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her Favored Soul level*10. Lay on hands can be used as a full round action or two full round actions. If used as a full round action the Favored Soul may choose to heal for a number of d6 equal to or less then her class level. If used with two full round actions the Favored Soul can heal any amount she chooses.

Using lay on hands provokes an attack of opportunity and if the Favored Soul is damaged she must succeed on a concentration check of DC 10 + damage dealt or she cannot use lay on hands.

**Bonus Languages**: A Favored Soul’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.
