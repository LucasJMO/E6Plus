**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Grapplers are not proficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

When wearing armor, using a weapon, shield, or carrying a heavy load, a gappler loses her class abilities.

**Unarmed Strike**: A 1st level grappler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A grappler's attacks may be either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a grappler may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off hand attack for a grappler striking unarmed. A grappler may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.

**Grapple Arts**: A 1st level grappler gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat. Additionally the grappler adds their class level as an untyped bonus on grapple checks.

**Weapon Finesse**: A grappler may use her Dexterity modifier instead of Strength modifier on unarmed attack rolls. 

**Grappling Finesse**: A grappler may use her Dexterity modifier instead of Strength on grapple checks.

**Takedown**: A 1st level grappler who makes a touch attack against an opponent in order to initiate a grapple may take a 5 foot step as a swift action before making the touch attack. This is in addition to other forms of movement for his turn.

At 3rd level, the grappler gains the ability to move up to 10 feet in this manner. At 5th level this increases to 15 feet. This movement does not provoke any attacks of opportunity.

Note that this ability does not allow movement that would otherwise be impossible. If the grappler is affected by some spell or condition restricting movement speed (solid fog, web, being prone)  they may not use this ability.

Also note that this ability requires the grappler to make an unarmed touch attack with the intention of beginning a grapple. If the grappler has some ability (for example, the feat Scorpion's Grasp) which allows him to initiate a grapple in some other manner, these attempts do not gain the benefits of this ability.

**Prone Movement**: A 2nd level grappler gains the ability to move up to half his land speed while prone. However any prone movement, no matter the distance, does provoke attacks of opportunity.

Additionally, standing up from prone requires a swift action rather than a move action.

**Leg Entaglement**: If an enemy within the threat range of a prone grappler makes a melee attack against the grappler, then the grappler has the option to make a touch attack of their own. If this attack succeeds then the grappler may make an opposed grapple check as a free action. 

Using this ability counts as making an attack of opportunity. 

**Counter Grappling**: A 2nd level grappler gains the ability to reverse the grappling attempts of his enemies. Any time a grappler wins a grapple check, regardless of who initiated the check, he may grapple the loser of the check. This includes grapple checks made by an enemy attempting to initiate a grapple, or grapple checks made to escape an enemy's grapple.

Note that this ability requires the enemy to be within the grappler's threat range.

**Improved Pin**: A 3rd level grappler gains the ability to initiate a pin with a single grapple check. If he wins an opposed grapple check by 5 or more he immediately pins the opponent.

**Defensive Grappler**: A 3rd level grappler does not lose his Dexterity bonus to AC while grappling. 

**Grapple Strike**: A 3rd level grappler who has an opponent grappled does not take any penalties on attack rolls against an opponent they are grappling. Additionally they add 1d6 damage to their attacks against foes who are being grappled.

**Impossible Grip**: A 4th level grappler gains the ability to grapple incorporeal creatures. While grappling, the grappler's unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction or incorporeal creatures.

**Powerful Grappler**: A 4th level grappler is treated as one size category larger than he is for grapple checks. This does not stack with other abilities which allow the grappler to be treated as one size category larger (for example the goliath ability powerful build).

**Choke**: A 5th level grappler who has pinned an opponent may use a standard action to initiate a choke. Make another opposed grapple check, if the grappler wins by 10 or more the opponent becomes stunned. Each turn the grappler may continue the choke by expending another standard action. When the grappler releases the choke the opponent remains stunned for another 1d4+1 rounds.

This ability only affects creatures who can be subject to critical hits or sneak attacks.

**Carry**: A 6th level grappler who has an opponent grappled may use a standard action to initiate a carry. Make another opposed grapple check, if the grappler wins by 10 or more the opponent is carried. The grappler may move and attack as normal, provided the opponent is not too heavy for them. They may not initiate another grapple without first releasing the opponent they are carrying. A grappler cannot initiate a carry against an opponent who has a greater weight than their maximum heavy load + 100 pounds.

Movement Speed | Weight of Carried Opponent
-------------- | --------------------------
Normal         | Light or Medium Load
Halved		   | Heavy Load
5 feet 		   | Heavy Load + 100 pounds
