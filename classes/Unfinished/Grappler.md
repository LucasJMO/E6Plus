**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Grapplers are not proficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

When wearing armor, using a weapon, shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a gappler loses her class abilities.

**Unarmed Strike**: A 1st level grappler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A grappler's attacks may be either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a grappler may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off hand attack for a grappler striking unarmed. A grappler may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.

**Improved Grapple**: A 1st level grappler gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat.

**Weapon Finesse**: A grappler may use her Dexterity modifier instead of Strength modifier on unarmed attack rolls. 

**Grappling Finesse**: A grappler may use her Dexterity modifier instead of Strength on grapple checks.

**Takedown**: A 1st level grappler who makes a touch attack against an opponent in order to initiate a grapple may take a 5 foot step as a swift action before making the touch attack. This is in addition to other forms of movement for his turn.

At 3rd level, the grappler gains the ability to move up to 10 feet in this manner. At 5th level this increases to 15 feet. This movement does not provoke any attacks of opportunity.

Note that this ability does not allow movement that would otherwise be impossible. If the grappler is affected by some spell or condition restricting movement speed (solid fog, web, being prone)  they may not use this ability.

Also note that this ability requires the grappler to make an unarmed touch attack with the intention of beginning a grapple. If the grappler has some ability (for example, the feat Scorpion's Grasp) which allows him to initiate a grapple in some other manner, these attempts do not gain the benefits of this ability.

**Prone Movement**: A 2nd level grappler gains the ability to move up to half his land speed while prone. However any prone movement, no matter the distance, does provoke attacks of opportunity.

Additionally, standing up from prone requires a swift action rather than a move action.

**Leg Entaglement**: If an enemy within the threat range of a prone grappler makes a melee attack against the grappler, then the grappler has the option to make a touch attack of their own. If this attack succeeds then the grappler may make an opposed grapple check as a free action. 

Using this ability counts as making an attack of opportunity. 

**Counter Grappling**: A 2nd level grappler gains the ability to reverse the grappling attempts of his enemies. Any time a grappler wins a grapple check, regardless of who initiated the check, he may grapple the loser of the check. This includes grapple checks made by an enemy attempting to initiate a grapple, or grapple checks made to escape an enemy's grapple.

Note that this ability requires the enemy to be within the grappler's threat range.

**Improved Pin**: A 3rd level grappler gains the ability to initiate a pin with a single grapple check. If he wins an opposed grapple check by 5 or more he immediately pins the opponent.

**Ground and Pound**: A 3rd level grappler who has an opponent grappled does not take any penalties
