**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).

**Spells**: A ranger casts divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare her spells in advance. 

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. 

**Favored Enemy**(Ex): At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on the table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls, and a +1 to crit range against such creatures.

**Track**: A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.

**Wild Empathy**(Ex): A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls a d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 ft of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minte, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.

**Point Blank Shot**: A 1st level ranger gains the feat Point Blank Shot, if he already has this feat then he may select another feat for which he meets the prerequisites.

**Combat Style**(Ex): A 2nd level ranger gains the feats, Rapid Shot and Two Weapon Fighting, even if he does not meet the normal prerequisites for the feat. The benefit of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light armor or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style while wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Endurance**: A ranger gains endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level. If they already have this feat they may select another feat for which they meet the prerequisites. 

**Quick Draw**(Ex): A ranger may change from bow to melee weapons (or vice-versa) as a swift action. Additionally a ranger may take attacks of opportunity with their melee weapon while they have their bow drawn.

**Power Slide**(Ex): If a 3rd level ranger takes damage from an attack, he may allow himself to be flung backwards, thereby lessening the impact. He may make a balance check with a DC equal to 5 + damage inflicted and if he succeeds he suffers only half damage. This is a skill check, not a save throw, so abilities such as evasion do no apply. He is moved away from the source of damage by 5' for every 5 points of damage (or part thereof) negated in this way. If there is not enough space for him to move, he suffers a d6 damage for each square not moved. If he passes through an occupied square, the ranger must make a tumble check to avoid attacks of opportunity.

**Bonus Feat**: At 3rd level the ranger gains a bonus feat along with any feats gained from their standard level progression.

**Opportunist**(Ex): Once per round, the ranger can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the ranger’s attack of opportunity for that round. Even a ranger with the Combat Reflexes feat can’t use the opportunist ability more than once per round.

**Improved Combat Style**(Ex): A 6th level ranger is treated as having the Manyshot feat and the Improved wo-Weapon Fighting feat even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for the feat. The benefits of the Ranger's chosen style only apply when he wears light or no armor.
