**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Spells**: A blackguard casts divine spells, which are drawn from the blackguard spell list. A blackguard must choose and prepare her spells in advance. 

To prepare or cast a spell, a blackguard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a blackguard's spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. 

**Aura of Evil**(Su): A blackguard's aura of evil is equal to her blackguard level.

**Detect Good**(Sp): At will, a blackguard can use detect good, as the spell.

**Smite Good**(Su): Once per day, a blackguard may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per blackguard level. If the blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. 

At 5th level the blackguard may smite good one additional time per day.

**Dark Blessing**(Su): A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.

**Deadly Touch**(Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a blackguard can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day he can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to his blackguard level * charisma modifier. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 blackguard level + charisma modifier) to halve the damage dealt.

Alternatively, a blackguard can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the blackguard's lay on hands ability.

**Command Undead**(Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.

**Aura of Despair**(Su): Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws.

**Dark Resilience**: A 3rd level blackguard may be infected with diseases and show symptoms, but does not suffer any of the ill effects (ability score damage, hit point damage, etc).

**Special Mount**(Sp): A 6th level blackguard gains the ability to summon an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium blackguard) or a warpony (for a Small blackguard). A blackguard's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects the depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

The summoning ritual requires an hour of unbroken meditation. Once summoned the mount is treated as a normal magical beast (it must be fed/rested), and remains until it drops to 0 hit points or is dismissed (dismissal is a free action), a mount that is killed or dismissed leaves behind no physical form. In either case repeating the ritual summons the same mount, restored to its hit point maximum.

## Blackguard Spell List

Level | Spells Known
----- | ------------
1 | Cause fear, corrupt weapon, cure light wounds, doom, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, summon monster 1 
2 | bull's strength, cure moderate wounds, darkness, death knell, eagle's splendor, inflict moderate wounds, shatter, summon monster 2

**The Blackguard's Mount**:

Bonus HD | Natural Armor Adjustment| Strength Adjustment | Intelligence | Special
-------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------
+2       | +4                      | +1                  | 6            | Empathic Link, Improved Evasion, Share Spells, Share Saving Throws

**Bonus HD**: Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Adjustment**: An improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.

**Strength Adjustment**: Add this figure to the mount's strength score.

**Intelligence**: The mount's Intelligence score.

**Empathic Link**(Su): The blackguard has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The blackguard cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.

**Improved Evasion**: When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

**Share Spells**: At the blackguard's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.

The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the blackguard before the duration expires. Additionally, the blackguard may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A blackguard and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).

**Share Saving Throws**: For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the blackguard's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.
