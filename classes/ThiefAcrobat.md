**Acrobatic Flair**: A Thief Acrobat may move her full movement while using the Tumble or Balance skill without suffering a penalty or increasing the DC of her check.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Thief Acrobats are proficient with all simple weapons, as well as the sap, the shortsword, the whip, the bolas, the long staff, and the shuriken. Thief Acrobats are proficient with light armor but not with shields of any kind.

**Pole Jump**: If holding a pole, spear, staff, long staff, or other pole-like object in both hands, a Thief Acrobat can add twice her reach to her final distance moved during a Jump check, and in this instance her jump distances are not limited by her height.

**Evasion**: A thief acrobat can avoid even magical and unusal attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the thief acrobat is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless thief acrobat does not gain the benefits of evasion.

**Sure Climb**: A Thief Acrobat gains a climb speed equal to half her movement speed.

**Athletic Cascade**: If a Thief acrobat moves before making an attack, for the purpose of flanking she may count any square she has moved through as threatening an opponent, in addition to the space she is actually attacking from. She may not, however, use this ability to flank with herself.

**Rapid Stealth**: A Thief acrobat does not suffer the -10 penalty to Move Silently or Hide for moving at her full normal speed.

**Detect Magic**(Sp): A Thief Acrobat may use detect magic at-will as a spell-like ability. A Thief Acrobat may use her Appraise Skill in place of her Spellcraft in order to glean additional information from her detect magic.

**Improved Evasion**: This ability works like evasion, except that while the thief acrobat still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless thief acrobat does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

**Moving Attack**: When using the attack action with a melee weapon, a thief acrobat can move both before and after the attack, provided that the total distance moved is not greater than her speed.

**Grapple Line**: A Thief Acrobat may fire a missile weapon designed as a grappling weapon at an unoccupied square and, if it does at least 1 point of damage to an object filling that square (wall, ceiling, statue, etc) or a securely affixed object (ceiling post, small statue, etc) the Thief acrobat may run a rope from his current position to that location as a full round action. He may then use this rope to make a Balance or Climb check as normal.

**Skill Mastery**: A Thief Acrobat is able to take 10 on any Appraise, Balance, Disable Device, Jump, Hide, Move Silently, and Tumble checks. 

**Mercurial Charge**: As a full round action, a thief acrobat may move up to twice her movement speed and then make a single attack at her full Base Attack Bonus. The thief acrobat may not move back on herself while using this form of movement, if she moves at least 10 feet before making her attack she adds +2 to her roll and -2 to her AC for the next turn. Tumble checks taken during this action suffer a penalty of -10.

A thief acrobat may even move along vertical surfaces using this ability, however each 5 feet moved across a vertical surface is equivalent to 10 feet moved across a horizontal surface.

Additionally, a thief acrobat who uses mercurial charge may flank with herself using spaces she threatens because of her athletic cascade ability.

**Death From Above**: Any attacks a thief acrobat makes after falling from a height of 15 or more feet qualify as sneak attacks.
