**Acrobatic Flair**: A Thief Acrobat may move her full movement while using the Tumble or Balance skill without suffering a penalty or increasing the DC of her check.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Thief Acrobats are proficient with all simple weapons, as well as the sap, the shortsword, the whip, the bolas, the long staff, and the shuriken. Thief Acrobats are proficient with light armor but not with shields of any kind.

**Pole Jump**: If holding a pole, spear, staff, long staff, or other pole-like object in both hands, a Thief Acrobat can add twice her reach to her final distance moved during a Jump check, and in this instance her jump distances are not limited by her height.

**Sure Climb**: A Thief Acrobat gains a climb speed equal to half her movement speed.

**Kip Up**: A Thief Acrobat may stand up from prone as a free action which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Detect Magic**: A Thief Acrobat may use detect magic at-will as a spell-like ability. A Thief Acrobat may use her Appraise Skill in place of her Spellcraft in order to glean additional information from her detect magic.

**Grapple Line**: A Thief Acrobat may fire a missile weapon designed as a grappling weapon at an unoccupied square and, if it does at least 1 point of damage to an object filling that square (wall, ceiling, statue, etc) or a securely affixed object (ceiling post, small statue, etc) the Thief acrobat may run a rope from his current position to that location as a full round action. He may then use this rope to make a Balance or Climb check as normal.

**Skill Mastery**: A Thief Acrobat is able to take 10 on any Appraise, Balance, Disable Device, Jump, Hide, Move Silently, and Tumble checks. 

**Rapid Stealth**: A Thief acrobat does not suffer the -10 penalty to Move Silently or Hide for moving at her full normal speed.

**Mercurial Charge**: A Thief Acrobat need not move in a straight line to charge, nor must she charge the closest available space. She still may not move back on herself during a charge.

**Athletic Cascade**: If a Thief acrobat moves before making an attack, for the purpose of flanking she may count any square she has moved through as threatening an opponent, in addition to the space she is actually attacking from. In this manner she may even flank with herself.

**Power Slide**:  If a 6th level Thief Acrobat takes damage from an attack, he may allow himself to be flung backwards, thereby lessening the impact. He may make a Balance check with a DC equal to the damage inflicted and if he succeeds, he suffers only half damage. This is a skill check, not a Save Throw, so abilities such as evasion do not apply. He is moved away from the source of damage by 5â€™ for every 5 points of damage (or part thereof) negated in this way. If there is not enough space for him to move, he suffers a d6 of damage for each square not moved. If he passes through an occupied square, the Thief Acrobat must make a tumble check to avoid attacks of opportunity.
