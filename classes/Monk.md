**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a Monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

**Flurry of Blows(FOB)**(Ex): When unarmored, a Monk may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it affects attacks of opportunity the Monk might make before her next action. When a Monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 6th level the penalty disappears.

When using flurry of blows, a Monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special Monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special Monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a Monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus * 1.5 or 0.5) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The Monk canâ€™t use any weapon other than a special Monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.

**Armor Class Bonus(ACB)**(Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, the Monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In Addition a Monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 2nd level, a +2 bonus at 4th level, and a +3 bonus at 6th level.

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the Monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

**Unarmored Speed Bonus(USB)**(Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, a 1st level Monk adds +10 to her land speed, at 3rd level this bonus increases to +20, and at 6th level it increases to +30.

**Acrobatic**(Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, a Monk adds her Monk level to Acrobatics and Athletics checks.

**Bonus Feat**: A 1st level Monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 3rd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. A Monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

**Unarmed Strike**: A 1st level Monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A Monk's attacks may be either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a Monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off hand attack for a Monk striking unarmed. A Monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes

**Damage Reduction**(Ex): At 2nd level a Monk gains Damage Reduction. Substract 1 from damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage. This reduction increases to 2/- at 4th level and 3/- at 6th level.

**Slow Fall**(Ex): At 2nd level or higher, a Monk can slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. At 4th level she takes damage as if the fall were 40 feet shorter than it actually is, and at 6th level she takes damage as if the fall were 60 feet shorter than it actually is.

**Evasion**(Ex): At 2nd level or higher, if a Monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can only be used if a Monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless Monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Still Mind**(Ex): A Monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

**Ki Strike**: A 4th level Monk's unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.

**Calm Spirit**(Ex): At the start of his turn a 5th level Monk may choose to activate calm spirit as a free action. While calm spirit is active the Monk loses his speed bonus and cannot use flurry of blows, however his armor class bonus and damage reduction (gained through Monk class features) are both doubled.

**Purity of Body**(Ex): At 5th level, a Monk gains immunity to all diseases, except for supernatural and magical diseases.

**Furious Fist**(Ex): A 6th level Monk may choose to activate furious fist as a free action. After activating furious fist he can take no further movement during his turn. While furious fist is active any damage the Monk deals or receives is doubled. Damage is doubled before damage reduction is applied. Furious fist only grants this benefit to melee attacks made by the Monk. Ending furious fist requires a standard action, furious fist cannot be active at the same time as calm spirit.

**Snap Kick**: A 6th level Monk gains Snap Kick as a bonus feat, if she already has this feat she may instead select a different feat for which she meets the prerequisites.
