**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Knights are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Code of Conduct**: A knight must abide by the following rules. Breaking any results in the loss of knightly abilities until atonement is completed. A knight must refuse bonuses from Aid Another actions in combat, a knight must refrain from the use of poisons of any kind, a knight may not voluntarily change shape, and a knight may not sell magic items.

**Draw Fire**: With a Swift Action, a knight may pique the interest of any opponent with intelligence 6 or less within 25 + 5/class level feet. That creature must make a will save (DC 10 + 1/2 knight level + constitution modifier) or spend all of its actions moving towards or attacking the knight. This effect ends after a number of rounds equal to the knightâ€™s class level.

**Shield Mastery**: A knight subtracts his knight level from the armor check penalty given by used shields. This ability can reduce a shield's armor check penalty to a minimum of 0.

**Bastion of Defense**: All adjacent allies except the knight gain a +2 Dodge bonus to their AC and Reflex Saves.

**Defensive Fighter**: A knight who chooses to fight defensively incurs only a -2 penalty on attack rolls and gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC.

**Energy Resistance**: As a swift action, a 3rd level knight may grant herself Energy Resistance against any type of energy equal to her knight Level plus her Shield Bonus (as with damage reduction, this bonus can only come from a physically held shield). This energy resistance lasts until she spends a Swift Action to choose another Energy type, or her Shield Bonus is reduced.

**Speak to Animals**: A knight gains a bonus to her Ride and Handle Animal checks equal to half her knight level.

**Damage Reduction**: A 4th level knight gains Damage Reduction X/-, where X is her knight level plus her shield bonus (this bonus can only come from a physically held shield, spells or magic items which grant a shield bonus do not enhance a knight's damage reduction) divided by two (rounded down). For example, a 6th level knight using a tower shield would have Damage Reduction 5/-.

**Immunity to Fear**: A knight is immune to Fear effects.

**Knightly Spirit**: As a Move equivalent action, a 4th level knight may restore any amount of attribute damage or drain that she has suffered.

**Sacrifice**: As an immediate action a knight may make herself the target of an attack or target effect that targets any creature within her reach.

**Mettle**: A knight who succeeds a Fortitude partial or Will partial save takes no effect as if she had immunity.

**Defend Others**: Any ally adjacent to the knight gains Evasion, although the knight does not.

**Quick Recovery**: If a knight is stunned or dazed during her turn, that condition ends at the end of that turn.
