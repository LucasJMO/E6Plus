**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Knights are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Code of Conduct**: A Knight must abide by the following rules. Breaking any results in the loss of Knightly abilities until atonement is completed. A Knight must refuse bonuses from Aid Another actions in combat, a Knight must refrain from the use of poisons of any kind, and a Knight may not voluntarily change shape.

**Draw Fire**: With a Swift Action, a Knight may pique the interest of any opponent within 60 feet. That creature must make a will save (DC 10 + 1/2 Knight level + constitution modifier) or spend all of its actions moving towards or attacking the Knight. This effect ends after a number of rounds equal to the Knightâ€™s class level, and creatures targeted by this effect can not be affected by it again for the next 24 hours (from the Knight targeting them, they can still be affected by other Knights using the ability).

In order to be targeted by this ability a creature must have an Intelligence score and that score must be 10 or less.

**Shield Mastery**: A Knight subtracts his Knight level from the armor check penalty given by used shields. This ability can reduce a shield's armor check penalty to a minimum of 0.

**Bastion of Defense**: All adjacent allies except the Knight gain a +2 Dodge bonus to their AC and Reflex Saves.

**Defensive Fighter**: A Knight who chooses to fight defensively incurs only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.

**Grounded**: A 2nd level Knight gains +1d6 on any attack he makes during any turn in which he takes no movement action apart from a 5 foot step.

**Energy Resistance**: A 3rd level Knight may expend a swift action to grant herself Energy Resistance against any type of energy equal to her Shield Bonus (as with damage reduction, this bonus can only come from a physically held shield). This energy resistance lasts until she spends a Swift Action to choose another Energy type, or her Shield Bonus is reduced.

**Speak to Animals**: A Knight gains a bonus to her Ride and Handle Animal checks equal to half her Knight level.

**Damage Reduction**: A 4th level Knight gains Damage Reduction X/-, where X is her shield bonus. This bonus can only come from a physically held shield, spells or magic items which grant a shield bonus do not enhance a Knight's damage reduction.

**Immunity to Fear**: A Knight is immune to Fear effects.

**Knightly Spirit**: As a Move equivalent action, a 4th level Knight may restore any amount of attribute damage or drain that she has suffered.

**Sacrifice**: As an immediate action a Knight may make herself the target of an attack or target effect that targets any adjacent creature. If the attack or effect being intercepted requires an attack roll, the Knight must declare that they are using sacrifice before the attack roll is made.

**Mettle**: A Knight who succeeds a Fortitude partial or Will partial save takes no effect as if she had immunity.

**Defend Others**: Any ally adjacent to the Knight gains Evasion, although the Knight does not.

**Immovable Stance**: A 6th level Knight gains the ability to adopt a defensive stance, granting him phenomenal strength and durability, but preventing him from taking any movement on his turn except for a single 5 foot step. A Knight in his immovable stance gains +4 to strength, +4 to constitution, +4 resistance bonus on all saves, +4 to AC, and +2 to his damage reduction.

Using or stopping the immovable stance takes no time itself, but a Knight can only do so during his action. A Knight suffers no penalties for exiting his stance, but he may only re-enter it after taking no physical actions for a full minute.

**Quick Recovery**: If a Knight is stunned, dazed, or paralyzed during her turn, that condition ends at the end of that turn.
