Class Feature | Explanation
------------- | -----------
Advanced Learning | At each level you can learn a spell from outside your own spell list. This spell cannot be higher than the highest level spell you can cast. You also can't delay learning spells this way (for example, you can't learn 4 2nd level spells and 2 3rd level spells).
Metamagician | 6 times per day you can apply one of Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Maximize Spell, Quicken Spell, Sculpt Spell, Silent Spell, or Widen Spell to a spell you cast without increasing the spell's level.
Summon Familiar | You gain a familiar and the benefits which it confers.
Scribe Scroll | You gain this as a bonus feat.
Spontaneous | At each level you may choose a spell from your spell list (or a spell learned via advanced learning) and gain the ability to cast it spontaneously, as a Sorcerer would. Doing so uses up a prepared spell of the same level.
