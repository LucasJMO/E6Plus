Class Feature | Explanation
------------- | -----------
Sneak Attack +3d6 | When you strike a target who is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, deal an additional 3d6 damage (as well as an additional 6 from Craven).
Advanced Learning | You may select 1 spell of 0-1st level and 2 spells of 0-2nd level and add them to your spell list.
Harlequin's Mask |  While your face is painted or masked you are immune to compulsion effects.
Ignore Components | You don't need material components to cast Jester spells. This does not apply to spells gained through Advanced Learning.
Poison Use | You may prepare, apply, and use poison without any chance of poisoning yourself.
Evasion | A successful Reflex saving throw negates all damage. You do not gain this benefit if helpless.
Laugh it Off | Add your Charisma modifier as a morale bonus to your saves. (Note that this cancels out the +2 morale bonus you get as halfling against fear effects)
Trick Throw/Quick Throw | You can use your Dexterity modifier to make ranged attack rolls with thrown weapons. Gain a +3 on Performance checks made to juggle, you may take 10 on such checks.
Weapon Sleeve | You may attempt a Stealth check for sleight of hand to hide weapons in your sleeves (you may take 10 or 20). The number of weapons which can be hidden this way is equal to the result of the check divided by 5 (rounded down). Up to 2 weapons concealed this way may be drawn as a swift or immediate action. 
Jester's Feint | As a swift action you may roll a Stealth check and force an opponent within 30ft to roll an opposed Spot check. If you win (draw goes to opponent) the opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus for any attacks you make this turn. Each subsequent time you target an enemy with this ability they gain a +10 bonus to their spot.
Improvised Weapon Master | You gain the benefits of the feat Two Weapon Fighting when using improvised weapons.
Killer Clown | If you have a painted/masked face, 3/day you can make a special Intimidate check as a move action. If successful, this check causes the enemy to suffer the frightened condition. If the Jester wins the check by 1-5, then they are frightened for 1 round, 6-10 is 2 rounds, and 11+ is 3 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature targeted by this effect cannot be affected by it again until 24 hours have elapsed.
Last Trick | If you are killed or knocked unconscious cast one of your spells known as if it were the spell in a contingency effect.
Pratfall | Any time you sneak attack an opponent you may make a free trip attempt which does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Use your Dexterity modifier for this attempt.
