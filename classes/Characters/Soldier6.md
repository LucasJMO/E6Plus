Class Feature | Explanation
------------- | -----------
Combat Focus             | You start every combat with 6 charges of combat focus. By expending a swift/immediate action and a charge of combat focus you may reroll any die roll you make. To regain all charges you must expend a full round action.
Active Assault           | If you could have taken a 5-foot step on your turn but didn't you may expend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step out of turn. If you do this you may not use any form of movement on your next turn.
Pack Mule                | You suffer no penalties for carrying a medium load and can retrieve/store items from your person with a swift action and without provoking an AoO.
Bide Your Time           | If you elect not to use an action on your turn you can instead store that action to take at a later point in the same combat. You can store either 1 full round action or 1 swift and 1 immediate action. If you store a full round action you may choose to take another turn either after your turn completes, or during a party member's turn (doing this out of turn also requires the use of an immediate action). You must announce what actions you are storing at the start of your turn.
Exotic Weapon Master     | You are proficient with all exotic weapons.
Array of Stunts          | You may use an immediate action without sacrificing the swift action on your next turn. Using a swift action still expends your immediate action.
Commander                | You can transfer your actions to a party member (stored actions can also be transferred). Doing so is a free action but expends a charge of combat focus. You must be able to use this action in order to transfer it. You can transfer out of turn but it requires the use of an immediate action.
Foil Action              | Expend a charge of combat focus to make a touch/ranged touch attack on a target within 30 ft. If this attack succeeds the opponent's action is wasted and  any spell slots, limited ability uses, potions, or the like are expended. Attacking, moving, and anything that takes an immediate, swift, or free action cannot be targeted with this ability. 
Greater Improved Healing | Each time you rest recover an addition hit point per hit die. Additionally heal 1 hitpoint every 10 minutes.
Bonus Feat x3            | You gain a bonus feat at 4th and 6th level.

Feat | Explanation
----- | -----------
Weapon Focus (Greatsword) | Gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with greatswords. Gained as 1st level feat.
Improved Initiative | You gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks. Gained as 3rd level feat.
Endurance | You gain a +4 bonus on checks or saves made to resist/avoid nonlethal damage from physical stress or exertion. You may sleep in light or medium armor without becoming fatigued. Gained as class feature.
Steadfast Determination | You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Wisdom modifier on Will saves. You do not automatically fail Fortitude saves on a 1. Gained as class feature.
Power Attack | Before making an attack action you may subtract a number less than or equal to your BAB from your attack roll and add it to your damage roll. Gained as 6th level feat.
