Scribe Scroll | You gain this as a bonus feat.
Spontaneous | At each level you may choose a spell from your spell list (or a spell learned via advanced learning) and gain the ability to cast it spontaneously, as a Sorcerer would. Doing so uses up a prepared spell of the same level. Choose 3 spells for this.
