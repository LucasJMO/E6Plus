**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Martial artists are proficient with all simple weapons, as well any weapon defined as a special monk weapon, such as the sai, the nunchaku, the kama, the shuriken, and the triple staff. Martial artists are not proficient with any armor or shields of any kind.

**Armored in Life**: A martial artist has a special armor bonus whenever they are not wearing armor or using a shield. This armor bonus applies against touch attacks and incorporeal touch attacks and has a value of +4. Every even numbered class level, the armored in life bonus increases by 1. 

**Anticipation**: If a martial artists would be allowed to add his Dexterity modifier to a Reflex Save or Armor Class, he may add his Wisdom bonus (if positive) instead.

**Fatal Strike**: A martial artist has a natural weapon Slam in addition to whatever else he is capable of doing. As a natural slam attack, if he uses no other natural or manufactured weapons he adds his Strength and a half to damage and may make iterative attacks if he has sufficient BAB. If the slam is used with other weaponry, it becomes a secondary natural attack, suffers a -5 penalty to-hit, and adds only half his Strength modifier to damage. A martial artist’s slam attack does a base of 1d8 damage for a medium sized martial artist and does more or less damage as appropriate if the martial artist is larger or smaller than medium size.

A martial artist's slam is treated as a magical weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Fighting Style**: At levels 1, 3, and 5, the martial artist learns a fighting style. Each fighting style requires a Swift Action to activate, lasts one round, and is usable at will. Each fighting style provides two bonuses selected from the list of fighting style abilities.

* While active, your fighting style provides a +4 Dodge Bonus to AC.
* While active, your fighting style provides a +4 Dodge Bonus to Saving Throws.
* While active, your fighting style allows you to make an attack of opportunity against any opponent who attacks you. This attack of opportunity must be a trip or disarm attempt.
* While active, your fighting style provides you with concealment.
* While active, your fighting style provides a +30’ Insight Bonus to your movement rate.
* While active, your fighting style transforms your slam attacks into Force effects which inflict Force damage and ignore hardness and DR.
* While active, your fighting style provides any bonuses it gives to your slam attack to any attack you make with any weapon.
* While active, your fighting style causes your slam attack to inflict piercing damage and to inflict a 2 point penalty to an ability score of your choice. You decide this ability score when you enter the fighting style, and changing it to another requires a Swift Action. If not fixed through alternate means this penalty remains for 1 minute per class level.
* While active, your fighting style causes your slam attack to inflict slashing damage and to reduce your opponent’s movement rate by 10’ every time they suffer damage from it, to a minimum of half the opponent's base movement speed. This reduction lasts for 1 minute per class level.
* While active, your fighting style allows you to move through occupied spaces as if they were unoccupied and you provoke no attacks of opportunity for your movement.
* While active, your fighting style allows you to shoot fire out of your mouth or hands as a standard action. The fire can be shout out to a maximum of 20 feet per class level, requires a ranged touch attack, and inflicts 1d4 of fire damage per class level if it hits.

**Rain of Flowers**: Any time a 2nd level martial artist inflicts lethal damage, he may elect to inflict non-lethal damage instead. Any time a martial atist inflicts non-lethal damage, he may elect to do lethal damage instead.

**Abundant Leap**: At 2nd level, a martial artist's ability to jump is unbounded by his height. In addition, the DC for any jump check is divided by 2.

**Slow Fall**: At 2nd level, a martial artist can slow his descent, when using this ability he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. At 3rd, and each level thereafter, she adds an additional 10 feet, up to 60 feet at 6th level.

**Acrobatic**: A martial artist adds his class level to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Swim, and Tumble checks.

**Evasion**: At 2nd level or higher, if a martial artist makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can only be used if a martial artist is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless martial artist does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Purity of Body**: At 5th level, a martial artist gains immunity to all diseases, except for supernatural and magical diseases.

**Master Style**: Once per day, a martial artist of sixth level or higher may activate a Fighting Style and extend its duration to 1 round/level rather than 1 round. Activating this Fighting Style is still a Swift Action. Other Fighting Styles may be activated during this period, though their duration is normally going to be only 1 round.
