**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A dread necromancer is proficient with all simple weapons and with one martial weapon of her choice. Her choice of martial weapon is made when the character takes her first level of dread necromancer and cannot be changed.

Dread necromancers are also proficient with light armor, but not with shields. The somatic components required for dread necromancer spells are simple, so members of this class can cast dread necromancer spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. She still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes. In addition, if a dread necromancer wears medium or heavy armor, or uses a shield, she incurs the same chance of arcane spell failure as any other arcane caster if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do).

**Spellcasting**: A dread necromancer casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dread necromancer's spell list (see below). Like a sorcerer, she can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. When a dread necromancer gains access to a new level of spells, she automatically knows all the spells for that level given on the dread necromancer's spell list. Dread necromancers also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below).

To cast a spell, a dread necromancer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a dread necromancer's spell is 10 + the spell's level + her Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a dread necromancer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given in the table above.

**Charnel Touch**(Su): Negative energy flows through a dread necromancer's body, concentrating in her hands. At will, but no more than once per round, she can make a melee touch attack against a living foe that deals 1d8 points of damage, +1 per three class levels. This touch heals undead creatures, restoring 1 hit point per touch, +1 per three class levels. A dread necromancer can use the spectral hand spell to deliver this attack from a distance.

**Rebuke Undead**(Su): A dread necromancer can rebuke or command undead creatures by channeling negative energy through her body. This functions identically to the cleric class feature of the same name, and dread necromancer levels stack with cleric levels for determining daily number of turning attempts.

**Lich Body**: Starting at 2nd level, a dread necromancer begins her journey into undeath. The first symptom is her body's increased resilience to physical harm. She gains DR 2/bludgeoning and magic. At 6th level this DR increases to 4.

**Mental Bastion**: Starting at 3rd level, a dread necromancer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist sleep, stunning, paralysis, poison, or disease.

**Negative Energy Burst**(Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a dread necromancer gains the ability to expend a standard action to emit a burst of negative energy from her body, harming living creatures within 5 feet of her. This burst deals 1d4 points of damage per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifier) reduces damage by half. Undead creatures (and the dread necromancer herself) within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures. A dread necromancer may use this ability once per day per two class levels (rounded down).

**Tomb-Tainted Soul**: A 3rd level dread necromancer gains the feat Tomb-Tainted Soul. If he already has this feat he may select another feat for which he meets the prerequisites.

**Advanced Learning**(Ex): At 4th and 6th level, a dread necromancer can add a new spell to her list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a cleric or wizard spell of the necromancy school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the dread necromancer already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that dread necromancer's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell she knows. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a dread necromancer.

**Fear Aura**(Su): Beginning at 5th level, a dread necromancer radiates a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken. A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected by that dread necromancer's fear aura for 24 hours.

**Scabrous Touch**(Su): Starting at 5th level, once per day a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches. This ability works like the contagion spell, inflicting the disease of her choice immediately, with no incubation period, unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier). The DC for subsequent saving throws to resist the effects of the disease depends on the disease inflicted.

Activating this class feature is a swift action. The effect lasts until the dread necromancer makes a successful charnel touch attack. The spectral hand spell enables a dread necromancer to deliver a scabrous touch attack from a distance.

**Undead Transformation**: A 6th level dread necromancer's type changes to undead, and it gains the augmented subtyped. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged. Hit dice are increased to d12, and the dread necromancer gains +4 turn resistance.

A 6th level dread necromancer no longer needs to sleep, however they still require 8 hours of unbroken rest in order to recover their daily spell alotment.
