**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Soulknives are proficient with all simple weapons, with their own mind blades, and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Mind Blade**(Su): As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The weapon is identical in all ways (except visually) to a normal weapon of its size and type. 

The weapon can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his weapon, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind weapon is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind weapon just as if it were a normal weapon. 

A soulknife’s weapon improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his weapon by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his weapon for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the weapon vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his weapon while he remains within the psionics negating effect.

**Weapon Focus**: A soulknife gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat, she may select any weapon for this feat. The bonuses from this feat apply to manifested mind weapons of the appropriate type.

**Throw Mind Blade**: A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.

Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).

**Psychic Strike**: As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue’s sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.)

A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action.

Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.

**Free Draw**: At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.

**Shape Mind Blade**:

**Minde Blade Enhancement**:

**Speed of Thought**:

**Bladewind**(Su): A soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.

As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife’s regular mind blade.

When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell).

The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.
