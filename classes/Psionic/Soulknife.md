**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Soulknives are proficient with all simple weapons, with their own mind blades, and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Mind Blade**(Su): As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The weapon is identical in all ways (except visually) to a normal weapon of its size and type. Despite being referred to as a mind blade, this can be any variety of weapon.

The mind blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his mind blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. 

Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.

A soulknife cannot dual wield a mind blade and a normal weapon, any attempt to do so causes the mind blade to dissipate.

**Martial Weapon Proficiency**: A soulknife gains Martial Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat, she may select any weapon for this feat. The benefits from this feat apply to manifested mind weapons of the appropriate type.

**Throw Mind Blade**: A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.

Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities.

**Psychic Strike**: A soulknife of 3rd level or higher imbues his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to living, nonmindless targets he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogueâ€™s sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.)

This psychich strike damage only applies to the first attack the soulknife successfully makes each round. If a soulknife scores a critical hit with his mind blade the psychic strike damage is not multiplied.

**Free Draw**: At 4th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.

**Mind Blade Enhancement**: At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.

The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.

A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.
