**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Soulknives are proficient with all simple weapons, with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Although a soulknife may become proficient with other forms of armor, wearing heavy armor prevents them from creating a mind blade.

**Mind Blade**(Su): As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The weapon is identical in all ways (except visually) to a normal weapon of its size and type. Despite being referred to as a mind blade, this can be any variety of weapon.

The mind blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his mind blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. 

Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.

A soulknife can dual wield a mind blade and a normal weapon, however a mind blade cannot be treated as an off-hand weapon.

Mind blades manifested by the soulknife gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls. At 3rd level that bonus increases to +2, and at 5th level it increases to +3.

**Martial Weapon Proficiency**: A soulknife gains Martial Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat, she may select any weapon for this feat. The benefits from this feat apply to manifested mind weapons of the appropriate type.

**Throw Mind Blade**: A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.

Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities.

**Free Draw**: At 3rd level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.

**Mind Blade Enhancement**: At 2nd level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities listed below. At 4th and 6th level he may apply another.

The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.

A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.

* The weapon's threat range is doubled. This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.

* A soulknife who kills an enemy with a melee attack using his mind blade may take a 5-foot step and make another melee attack at the same bonus.

* The mind blade deals an additional 1d6 force damage.

* The mind blade deals an additional 2d6 force damage, however on successful hits the soulknife takes 1d6 force damage.

* The soulknife gains the benefit of the feat Improved Sunder on sunder attempts made with a mind blade.

* On a successful critical hit using the mind blade, the soul knife gains 5 temporary hit points. These hitpoints expire after 10 minutes, and the number of temporary hitpoints gained through this ability at any one time cannot exceed 10.

* The soulknife gains a +4 bonus to initiative rolls.

* The mind blade deals an additional 2d8 damage to undead creatures.
