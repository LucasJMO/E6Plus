**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An Elocater is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor.

**Power Points/Day**: An elocater's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on the table above. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. A 1st or 2nd-level elocater gains no power points for his class level, but he gains bonus power points (if he is entitled to any), and can manifest the single power he knows with those power points.

**Powers Known**: An elocater begins play knowing one elocater power of your choice, at level 3 and level 6 he unlocks knowledge of a new power.

Choose the powers known from the psychic warrior power list. An elocater can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.

The total number of powers an elocater can manifest in a day is limited only by his daily power points.

An elocater simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.

The Difficulty Class for saving throws against elocater powers is 10 + the power's level + the elocater's Wisdom modifier.

**Maximum Power Level Known**: An elocater begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability to master more complex powers.

To learn or manifest a power, an elocater must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

**Scorn Earth**(Su): A 1st level elocater gains the ability to float a foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or difficult terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a flat surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions and make normal attacks, and can move at her normal speed (she can even "run" at up to four times her normal speed). At distances higher than 1 foot she falls, but may slow her speed to a mere 60 feet per round (if she chooses). 

From levels 1 to 5 this ability is usable for ten minutes per class level per day, however a 6th level elocater gains unlimited use of this ability. Activating or deactivating this ability requires a free action. Once active this ability remains active either until it is deactivated by the elocater, the elocater dies, or the daily use limit is reached. An elocater may only use this ability while wearing light, medium, or no armor.

**Capricious Step**(Ex): A 2nd level elocater can expend an immediate action to take an extra 5-foot step in any round when she doesn't perform any other movement (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character can take the extra 5-foot step at any point before the beginning of her next turn. In all other ways, the rules for taking a 5-foot step apply.

**Opportunistic Strike**(Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, an elocater gains a +2 insight bonus on her attack and damage rolls for the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt damage in melee by another character since the elocater's last action. At 5th level the insight bonus increases to +4.

**Dimension Step**(Su): A 4th level elocater gains the ability to teleport a short distance. Using this ability requires a swift action, the max range traveled is 10 feet per elocater level, he must have a line of sight to the desired destination, and if this ability would put him in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, it fails, and the use is expended. This form of movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and is usable once per day per 2 class levels (rounded down). An elocater may only use this ability while wearing light, medium, or no armor.

**Flanker**(Ex): A 4th level elocater can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined (including the square in which she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.

**Accelerated Actions**(Su): When she attains 6th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 6 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such as schism or a haste spellâ€”and in fact an elocater can't take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)

If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.
