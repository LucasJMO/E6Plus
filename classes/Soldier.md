**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level a soldier gains a bonus feat in addition to any feats from their normal level progression.

**Combat Focus**(Ex): A soldier begins any combat encounter in combat focus. He may end his combat focus at any time to reroll any die roll he makes, and if not used it ends on its own after a number of combat rounds equal to his class level. Voluntarily ending combat focus requires the use of a swift action (or an immediate action if it is not the soldier's turn), re-entering combat focus after ending it requires the use of a move action.

**Active Assault**(Ex): A 2nd level soldier gains the ability to take his 5-foot steps out of turn. If on his turn he would have been allowed to take a 5-foot step but elected not to, he may expend an immediate action any time before his next turn to take a 5-foot step. If he took a 5-foot step (or any other form of movement) on his previous turn, he may still expend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step, but if he does, he may not take any other forms of movement on his next turn.

**Problem Solver**(Ex): A 2nd level soldier may expend a swift action and gain the benefits of any [Combat] feat for which he meets the prerequisites and use it for a number of rounds equal to his class level. This ability may be used once per hour.

**Pack Mule**(Ex): A 3rd level soldier suffers no penalties for carrying a medium load, and may retrieve stored items from his person with a swift action, and without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

**Exotic Weapon Master**: A 4th level soldier gains the ability to become proficient with any exotic weapon. In order to do so he must spend at least 4 hours a day training with it over the course of a week.

**Array of Stunts**(Ex): A 5th level soldier may use an immediate action without sacrificing his swift action on his next turn.

**Foil Action**(Ex): A 6th level soldier may use an immediate action to make a touch attack or ranged touch attack on any opponent within 30 ft. If this attack succeeds the opponent's action is wasted, and any spell slots, limited ability uses, potions, or the like used to power it are expended.

The only actions exempt from this ability are attacking (standard action or full round), moving (standard, full round, or 5-foot step), and anything that takes a swift, immediate, or free action. After using this ability a soldier must wait one round before using it again.
