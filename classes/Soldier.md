**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A Soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level a Soldier gains a bonus feat in addition to any feats from their normal level progression.

**Combat Focus**(Ex): A Soldier begins any combat encounter with one charge of combat focus per class level. He may expend a charge of combat focus at any time to reroll any die roll he makes. Expending a charge of combat focus requires the use of a swift action (or an immediate action if it is not the Soldier's turn), regaining all charges requires a full round action.

**Active Assault**(Ex): A 2nd level Soldier gains the ability to take his 5-foot steps out of turn. If on his turn he would have been allowed to take a 5-foot step but elected not to, he may expend an immediate action any time before his next turn to take a 5-foot step. If he took a 5-foot step (or any other form of movement) on his previous turn, he may still expend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step, but if he does, he may not take any other forms of movement on his next turn.

**Problem Solver**(Ex): A 2nd level Soldier may expend a swift action and gain the benefits of any [Combat] feat for which he meets the prerequisites and use it for a number of rounds equal to his class level. This ability may be used once per hour.

**Pack Mule**(Ex): A 3rd level Soldier suffers no penalties for carrying a medium load, and may retrieve stored items from his person with a swift action, and without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

**Exotic Weapon Master**(Ex): A 4th level Soldier is proficient with all exotic weapons.

**Improved Healing**(Ex): A 4th level Soldier gains an enhancement to their natural healing abilities. Every time a Soldier rests they recover an additional hit point per hit die. 

**Bide Your Time**(Ex): A 4th level Soldier who elects not to use an action on his turn can instead store that action and take it at a later point in the same combat. A Soldier may store either one full round action or one swift and one immediate action. If he stores a full round action he may choose to take another turn either after his turn completes, or during a party member's turn (doing this requires the use of an immediate action as well). The Soldier must announce what actions he is storing at the start of his turn.

**Array of Stunts**(Ex): A 5th level Soldier may use an immediate action without sacrificing his swift action on his next turn. Using a swift action on your turn still prevents you from using an immediate action before your next turn.

**Commander**(Ex): A 5th level Soldier may transfer his swift or immediate actions to a party member. Doing so is a free action, he must have a swift or immediate action in order to transfer it (stored actions can be transferred as well). Transferring actions can be done out of turn.

**Foil Action**(Ex): A 6th level Soldier may expend a charge of combat focus to make a touch attack or ranged touch attack on any opponent within 30 ft. If this attack succeeds the opponent's action is wasted, and any spell slots, limited ability uses, potions, or the like used to power it are expended.

The only actions exempt from this ability are attacking (standard action or full round), moving (standard, full round, or 5-foot step), and anything that takes a swift, immediate, or free action. After using this ability a Soldier must wait one round before using it again.

**Greater Improved Healing**(Ex): A 6th level Soldier's healing improves even further, letting them recover 1 hitpoint for every 10 minutes spent out of combat.
