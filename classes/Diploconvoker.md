**Spells**: A Diploconvoker casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the Diploconvoker spell list below. A Diploconvoker automatically knows every spell on his spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing them ahead of time, provided that spell slots of an appropriate level are still available. To cast a spell, the Diploconvoker must have a charisma score of 10 + spell level. The DC for a saving throw against a Diploconvoker’s spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Diploconvokers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with the diploconvoker's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spontaneous Summoning**: At 1st level, a Diplconvoker can lose a spell to cast Summon Monster 1, Summon Nature’s Ally 1, or Summon Undead 1.

At 3rd level a Diploconvoker can lose a spell of 1st level or higher in order to cast Summon Monster 2, Summon Nature’s Ally 2, or Summon Undead 2.

At 5th level a Diploconvoker can lose a spell of 2nd level in order to cast Summon Monster 3, Summon Nature’s Ally 3, or Summon Undead 3. 

**Diplomatic Summons**: When casting a Summon Monster/Nature’s Ally/Undead spell a Diploconvoker can attempt a Diplomacy check on a summoned creature with an intelligence score greater than 5 and with which the diploconvoker has a shared language. This check requires a free action, and is opposed by the creature’s HD times 4, plus the total number of creatures summoned by the spell. Additional penalties are incurred for alignment differences. 

A Neutral Diploconvoker attempting to summon a Good or Evil being (or vice versa) receives a -2 penalty to their Diplomacy check. A Good Diploconvoker attempting to summon an Evil being (or vice versa) receives a -4 penalty on their Diplomacy check.

A Neutral Diploconvoker attempting to summon a Lawful or Chaotic being (or vice versa) receives a -1 penalty on their Diplomacy check. A Lawful Diploconvoker attempting to summon a Chaotic being (or vice versa) receives a -2 penalty on their Diplomacy check.

If the check succeeds, the duration of the effect is doubled. Failing this check by less than 5 has no effect, however if you fail this check by 5 or more, the creature breaks free of your control and is hostile towards you (though it still disappears as normal when the spell’s duration ends). You must attempt an opposed check separately against each creature you wish to affect.

Beginning at 4th level, if the check succeeds, then creatures additionally receive a +2 bonus on damage rolls and 2 extra hit points per HD.

Beginning at 6th level, if the check succeeds, then creatures gain an additional +2 bonus on Will saves, and your effective caster level is increased by 2 for the purpose of resisting dispel magic and similar effects against those creatures.

**Unrestricted Conjuration**: For the purpose of casting conjuration spells, you can ignore any restrictions that forbid you from casting spells of certain alignments. In addition, regular use of conjuration spells with the evil descriptor does not threaten to change your alignment.

**Summon Elemental**(Su): A Diploconvoker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to class level. All summons coming from this ability have a duration of one minute per class level. If multiple elementals are summoned with a single usage of this ability they do not have to be of the same type.

At 1st level a Diploconvoker can summon a small elemental as a standard action.

At 2nd level the Diploconvoker gains the ability to summon two small elementals as a standard action or summon one small elemental as a swift action.

At 3rd level the Diploconvoker gains the ability to summon four small elementals as a full round action.

At 4th level the Diploconvoker gains the ability to summon a medium elemental as a standard action. Summoning an elemental this way requires two of the Diploconvoker's daily usages of the summon elemental ability.

At 5th level the Diploconvoker gains the ability to summon two medium elementals by spending two full rounds concentrating on this ability. Using the ability in this way requires 3 of its daily usages. They can take no other actions during this time, and if they are hit or receive damage from any source during this process then the attempt fails and the usages is lost. 

The maximum number of elementals which can be summoned at one time is equal to the diploconvoker's class level. If the diploconvoker attempts to summon a number of elementals which would take them over this limit, the summoning instead produces the maximum allowable number of elementals and the use is expended.

**Negotiator**: A first level Diploconvoker receives the feat negotiator, if you already possess this feat, you may select a different feat which you meet the requirements for.

**Rapid Summoning**: Summoning spells requiring a full round action to cast instead take a standard action.
 
**Skill Focus (Diplomacy)**: A 3rd level Diploconvoker receives the feat Skill Focus (Diplomacy), if you already possess this feat, you may select a different feat which you meet the requirements for.

**Legion**: At 5th level, when casting a Summon Monster/Nature’s Ally/Undead spell, you summon an additional creature from a lower level list. For example a Diploconvoker casting Summon Undead 3 could select to summon a Ghoul from the 3rd level list, and an Owlbear Skeleton from the 2nd level list.

**Minor Planar Ally**(Su): Once per week, a diploconvoker may perform a ten minute long ritual to call one elemental or outsider with no more than 4 HD. This ability functions like th espell Lesser Planar Ally, except that no gp payment is needed.
