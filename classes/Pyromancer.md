**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Pyromancers are proficient with all simple weapons, as well as the whip, all martial axes, and all sizes and varieties of scimitar (including falchions). Pyromancers are proficient with light armor, but not shields of any kind.

Although a pyromancer can become proficient with other forms of armor, wearing medium or heavy armor prevents them from using fire bolts, ignite, or fireballs.

**Fire Resistance**: A Pyromancer has a resistance to fire equal to twice his class level.

**Fire Burst**(Su): As a standard action, a Pyromancer can emit a burst of flame from his body, striking all creatures and objects within 10’ of his position except himself. This burst of flames inflicts 1d4 of fire damage per class level, with an allowed Reflex Save for half (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + charisma modifier)

**Fire Bolts**(Su): A Pyromancer can throw bolts of fire as a standard action. A Fire Bolt has a range increment of 120 feet, requires a ranged touch attack to hit, and inflicts 1d4 of Fire damage per Pyromancer level, up to a maximum of 6d4 at 6th level.

**Impress Flames**: Every time a Pyromancer inflicts Fire damage on any target, whether with his class abilities or another source of fire, he inflicts an amount of extra Fire Damage equal to his class level.

**Fire Magic**: A Pyromancer is considered to have every spell with the Fire Descriptor on his spell list for the purpose of activating magic items.

**Ignite**(Su): As a standard action, a 2nd level Pyromancer can cause any creature or object to burst into flame. A creature on fire suffers 1d4 of Fire damage per round on their turn (the Mage’s Impress Flames ability applies to each round). At the start of its turn, the creature can expend a move equivalent action to attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + charisma modifier), if the creature succeeds it still takes damage for the turn, however the flames are extinguished. If the flames are not extinguished they go out on their own after three rounds. This ability can be used out to 20 feet per level, and it always hits.

**Smokeless Flame**(Su): A 2nd level Pyromancer can create fires that produce no heat and do not burn. These fires can be anything from the size of a torch to a bonfire, and produce light accordingly. Each lasts for 1 hour per class level. Smokeless Flame can be created anywhere within medium range.

**Piercing Flames**: From 3rd level on, a Pyromancer’s fire cuts through Fire Resistance, hardness, damage reduction, and Immunity. No more than 1/2 of the damage inflicted by his fire can be negated by hardness, immunity, damage reduction, or resistance to fire. In addition, the Pyromancer ignores the first 5 points of Fire Resistance or damage reduction that a target has.

**Hands of Fire**(Su): A 3rd level Pyromancer can set fire to their own body, causing them to count as armed at all times, even with unarmed attacks. The Pyromancer also causes an extra 1d4 of Fire damage with all melee attacks. Beginning this effect requires a swift action, but it may be ended as a free action.

**Fire Immunity**: At 4th level a Pyromancer is immune to fire.

**Fireballs**(Su): A 5th level Pyromancer can hurl explosive fire anywhere within 20 feet per level as a Full Round Action. This Fire explodes into a 10’ radius and inflicts 1d4 of Fire Damage per level. All creatures within the area are entitled to a Reflex save to halve damage (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Charisma Modifier). 

**Mind of Fire**(Su): As a standard action, 6th level Pyromancer can duplicate the effects of rage or confusion for 3 rounds. The target must be within short range, and is entitled to a Will Save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Charisma Modifier). This is a mind influencing compulsion effect, and an individual targeted by this ability cannot be affected by it again for another 24 hours.
