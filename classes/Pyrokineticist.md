**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Pyrokineticists are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Pyrokineticists are proficient with light armor and medium armor, but not shields of any kind.

Although a pyrokineticist can become proficient with other forms of armor, wearing heavy armor prevents them from using fire burst or creating a fire weapon.

**Fire Weapon**(Su): A pyrokineticist gains the ability to fashion a melee weapon of fire from unstable ectoplasm as a move-equivalent action. She takes no damage from the weapon she creates, and if she releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. A fire weapon can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a pyrokineticist can simply create another on her next move action.

A weapon manifested in this way is treated as a normal weapon of its size and type, except that at each even numbered level it gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage to a target it strikes. This additional fire damage is only applied to the first successful melee attack a pyrokineticist makes each turn, and is not multiplied if the pyrokineticist scores a critical hit with their flame weapon. 

A pyrokineticist can dual wield a fire weapon and a normal weapon, however a fire weapon cannot be treated as an off-hand weapon. A fire weapon is treated as a magical weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Fire Resistance**(Ex): A pyrokineticist has a resistance to fire equal to twice his class level.

**Nimbus**(Su): Once per day per two class levels (rounded up) a pyrokineticist can wreathe himself in flames. While nimbus is active the pyrokineticist's Charisma score increases by 4, he gains damage reduction 2/-, his speed increases by 10, and creatures who strike him in melee suffer 1d6 points of fire damage. Activating nimbus requires a free action and it lasts for 3 + the pyrokineticist's constitution modifier rounds.

**Fire Burst**(Su): As a standard action, a 2nd level Pyrokineticist can emit a burst of flame from his body, striking all creatures and objects within 10’ of his position except himself. This burst of flames inflicts 1d4 points of fire damage per class level, with an allowed Reflex Save for half (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + charisma modifier)

**Fire Bolts**(Su): A Pyrokineticist can throw bolts of fire as a standard action. A Fire Bolt has a range of 60 feet, requires a ranged touch attack to hit, and inflicts 1d4 of Fire damage per two class levels (rounded down), up to a maximum of 3d4 at 6th level.

**Piercing Flames**(Su): From 3rd level on, a pyrokineticist’s fire cuts through Fire Resistance, hardness, and Immunity. No more than 1/2 of the damage inflicted by his fire can be negated by hardness, immunity, or resistance to fire. In addition, the pyrokineticist ignores the first 5 points of Fire Resistance that a target has.

**Smokeless Flame**(Su): A 3rd level pyrokineticist can create fires that produce no heat and do not burn. These fires can be anything from the size of a torch to a bonfire, and produce light accordingly. Each lasts for 1 hour per class level. Smokeless Flame can be created anywhere within medium range.

**Explosive Charge**(Ex): From 4th level on, a pyrokineticist who charges may expend a swift action to activate a fire burst at any point during their charge. This ability is usable three times per day.

**Fire Immunity**(Ex): At 4th level a pyrokineticist is immune to fire.

**Free Draw**(Ex): Beginning at 5th level a pyrokineticist can create a fire weapon as a free action.

**Firewalk**(Su): Once per day per level a 6th level pyrokineticist can expend a free action to gain the ability to walk on air for one round. She moves at her normal speed in all directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her speed in a round. A firewalking pyrokineticist leaves footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal damage.
