**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Pyrokineticists are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Pyrokineticists are proficient with light armor and medium armor, but not shields of any kind.

Although a pyrokineticist can become proficient with other forms of armor, wearing heavy armor prevents them from using fire burst, fire bolts, or creating a fire weapon.

**Fire Weapon**: A pyrokineticist gains the ability to fashion a melee weapon of fire from unstable ectoplasm as a move-equivalent action. She takes no damage from the weapon she creates, and if she releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. 

A weapon manifested in this way is treated as a normal weapon of its size and type, except that it deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage to a target it strikes. At 4th level this additional damage increases to 2d6, and at 6th level it reaches a maximum of 3d6. This additional fire damage is not multiplied if the pyrokineticist scores a critical hit with their flame weapon.

**Fire Resistance**: A pyrokineticist has a resistance to fire equal to twice his class level.

**Fire Burst**: As a standard action, a Pyrokineticist can emit a burst of flame from his body, striking all creatures and objects within 10’ of his position except himself. This burst of flames inflicts 1d4 of fire damage per class level, with an allowed Reflex Save for half (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + charisma modifier)

**Fire Bolts**: A pyrokineticist can throw bolts of fire as a standard action. A Fire Bolt travels out to short range, requires a ranged touch attack to hit, and inflicts 1d4 of Fire damage per pyrokineticist level, up to a maximum of 6d4 at 6th level.

**Piercing Flames**: From 3rd level on, a pyrokineticist’s fire cuts through Fire Resistance, hardness, and Immunity. No more than 1/2 of the damage inflicted by his fire can be negated by hardness, immunity, or resistance to fire. In addition, the pyrokineticist ignores the first 5 points of Fire Resistance that a target has.

**Smokeless Flame**(Su): A 3rd level pyrokineticist can create fires that produce no heat and do not burn. These fires can be anything from the size of a torch to a bonfire, and produce light accordingly. Each lasts for 1 hour per class level. Smokeless Flame can be created anywhere within medium range.

**Explosive Charge**: From 4th level on, a pyrokineticist who charges may expend a swift action to activate a fire burst at any point during their charge.

**Fire Immunity**: At 4th level a pyrokineticist is immune to fire.

**Nimbus**: Beginning at 5th level, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither the pyrokineticist nor her equipment engulf her entire body. While she is aflame, the character’s Charisma score increases by 4 and she gains damage reduction 5/magic. If she is struck in melee, the attacker takes 2d4 points of fire damage. This ability lasts for up to 1 round per pyrokineticist level and is usable once per day.

**Firewalk**: Once per day per level a 6th level pyrokineticist can expend a free action to gain the ability to walk on air for one round. She moves at her normal speed in all directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her speed in a round. A firewalking pyrokineticist leaves footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal damage.
