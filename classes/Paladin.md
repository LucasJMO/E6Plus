**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Spells**: A paladin casts divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance. 

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. 

**Aura of Good**: A paladin's aura of good is equal to her paladin level.

**Detect Evil**(Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.

**Smite Evil**(Su): Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. 

At 5th level the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day.

**Divine Grace**(Su): A 2nd level paladin gains a bonus equal to her charisma bonus on all saving throws.

**Healing Word**(Su): A 2nd level paladin can invoke divine energy to heal herself or others. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to paladin level * charisma modifier (treat any charisma modifier less than or equal to 0 as 1). A paladin may heal any amount with one use of healing word. Using healing word is a swift action.

**Harm Undead**(Su): A 2nd level paladin may draw from the same pool as healing word in order to harm undead creatures. Using harm undead requires a successful melee touch attack (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). After successfully touching the undead creature, the paladin decides how many points to use from his daily allotment. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + charisma modifier) to halve the damage dealt.

**Aura of Courage**(Su): A 3rd level paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.

**Divine Health**: A 3rd level paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

**Turn Undead**(Su): A 4th level paladin gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.

**Brilliant Champion**(Su): A 6th level paladin gains darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 2/-, and +2 Charisma. Additionally as a free action she can choose to emanate a dim glow, illuminating all adjacent spaces.

**Remove Disease**(Sp): A 6th level paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week.

**Special Mount**(Sp): A 6th level paladin gains the ability to summon an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin). A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects the depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

The summoning ritual requires an hour of unbroken meditation. Once summoned the mount is treated as a normal magical beast (it must be fed/rested), and remains until it drops to 0 hit points or is dismissed (dismissal is a free action), a mount that is killed or dismissed leaves behind no physical form. A dismissed mount can be summoned again by repeating the ritual. A mount that is killed can not be summoned again until the paladin visits a shrine or temple to their god, and spends a day in meditation there.

**The Paladin's Mount**:

Bonus HD | Natural Armor Adjustment| Strength Adjustment | Intelligence | Special
-------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------
+2       | +4                      | +1                  | 6            | Empathic Link, Improved Evasion, Share Spells, Share Saving Throws

**Bonus HD**: Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Adjustment**: An improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.

**Strength Adjustment**: Add this figure to the mount's strength score.

**Intelligence**: The mount's Intelligence score.

**Empathic Link**(Su): The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.

**Improved Evasion**: When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

**Share Spells**: At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.

The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).

**Share Saving Throws**: For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.
