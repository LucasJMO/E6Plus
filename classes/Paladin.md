**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with all shields (including tower shields).

**Spells**: A paladin casts divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance. 

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. 

**Bonus Feat**: A 3rd level paladin gains a bonus feat along with any feats from their level progression.

**Aura of Good**(Ex): A paladin's aura of good is equal to her paladin level.

**Detect Evil**(Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.

**Smite Evil**(Su): Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. 

At 5th level the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day.

**Divine Grace**(Su): A 2nd level paladin gains a bonus equal to her charisma bonus on all saving throws.

**Harm Undead**(Su): A 2nd level paladin may draw from the same pool as healing word in order to harm undead creatures. Using harm undead requires a successful melee touch attack (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). After successfully touching the undead creature, the paladin decides how many points to use from his daily allotment.

**Healing Word**(Su): A 2nd level paladin can invoke divine energy to heal herself or others. Each day he can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to 15 + paladin level * charisma modifier (treat any charisma modifier less than or equal to 0 as 1). A paladin may heal any amount with one use of healing word. Using healing word is a swift action.

**Aura of Courage**(Su): A 3rd level paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.

**Divine Health**(Ex): A 3rd level paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

**Turn Undead**(Su): A 4th level paladin gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.

**Defensive Fighter**(Ex): A Paladin who chooses to fight defensively incurs only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.

**Special Mount**(Sp): A 5th level paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).

**Remove Disease**(Sp): A 6th level paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week.

**Defense Specialist**(Ex): A paladin may use total defense (+4 dodge bonus to AC for the round) as a move action rather than a standard action.
