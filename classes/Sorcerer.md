**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a Sorcerer’s gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A Sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the Sorcerer/Wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a Wizard or a cleric must (see below).

To learn or cast a spell, a Sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a Sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the Sorcerer’s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a Sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.

A Sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A Sorcerer begins play knowing six 0-level spells and four 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new Sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a Sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; Sorcerer spells known are fixed). These new spells can be common spells chosen from the Sorcerer/Wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the Sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The Sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.

Upon reaching 4th or 6th level a Sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the Sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level Sorcerer spell the Sorcerer can cast. A Sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a Wizard or a Cleric, a Sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.

**Familiar**: A Sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The Sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the Sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

**Advanced Learning**: Each time a Sorcerer gains a level he can learn one additional spell from any spell list he desires.

**Metamagician**: Once per day per class level a Sorcerer can apply one of Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Maximize Spell, Quicken Spell, Silent Spell, or Widen Spell to a spell he casts without increasing the spell's level.

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd and 6th level, a Sorcerer gains a bonus feat. She can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The Sorcerer must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The Sorcerer is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.

**Studious**: A 2nd level Sorcerer gains the ability to prepare 1 spell per day in the same way a Wizard would (however a Sorcerer does not need a spellbook to study). A spell prepared in this way may only be cast once per day but otherwise functions like the Sorcerer's spontaneous casting. At 4th and 6th level the Sorcerer gains the ability to prepare an additional spell (up to a maximum of 3).
