**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Sneak Attack**: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. 

The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonux to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 damage every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak atack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

**Trapfinding**: Rogues can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task hs a Difficulty Class higher than 20. 

Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

Rogues can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

A rogue who beats the trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.

**Evasion**: A rogue can avoid even magical and unusal attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefits of evasion.

**Trap Sense**: A 3rd level rogue gains a +1 bonus to Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level.

**Uncanny Dodge**: Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

## Special Ability 

A rogue may select one of crippling strike, dark caster, defensive roll, hide in plain sight, improved evasion, opportunist, power slide, skill mastery, slippery mind, or bonus feat.

**Crippling Strike**: A successful sneak attack deals two points of strength damage or dex damage. This ability may be gained multiple times, each time adding an additional two points of either form of damage.

**Dark Caster**: A rogue can learn an illusion spell of 2nd level or lower and cast it a number of times per day equal to rogue level divided by 2 (rounded down, minimum 0). Save DC is 10 + spell level + Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). This ability may be gained twice, but must choose a different spell each time. Treat rogue level as caster level.

**Defensive Roll**: If an attack (from a weapon or some other blow) would reduce a rogue to 0 or fewer hit points. The rogue may attempt a reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage from the blow.

**Hide in Plain Sight**: A rogue with hide in plain sight can use the Hide skill even while being observed (as long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow). He cannot however, hide in his own shadow.

**Greater Improved Healing**: A rogue gains an enhancement to their natural healing abilities. For every 60 minutes a rogue spends out of combat they recover 1 hitpoint. This is in addition to hitpoints regained via other methods (resting for example).

**Jester's Feint**: As a swift action a rogue may toss a brightly colored object in the square of an enemy with a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the enemy’s Spot check. If he succeeds, the enemy is denied his Dex bonus for the rogue’s next attack. This ability has a range of 30 ft.

An enemy targeted by this ability multiple times gains a +5 bonus to Spot for each prior time he has been targeted, regardless of who won the prior checks. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.

**Jester's Trip**: A rogue who strikes an opponent with a melee sneak attack, may make a free trip attempt which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Opportunist**: Once per round, a rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.

**Rapid Stealth**: A rogue does not suffer the -10 penalty to Move Silently or Hide for moving at her full normal speed.

**Skill Mastery**: Upon gaining this ability, the rogue selects a number of skills equal to 3 + Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skils, he may take 10 even if stress and distraction would normally prevent such a thing. This ability may be gained multiple times.

**Slippery Mind**: If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell and fails the saving throw, he can attempt it again 1 round later at the original DC - 3. This is the only extra chance to succeed the saving throw.

**Unsettling Choreography**: A rogue may use her Dexterity modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making trip or bullrush attempts.
