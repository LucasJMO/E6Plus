**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Sneak Attack**: If a Rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. 

The Rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the Rogue flanks her target. This extra damage 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 damage every two Rogue levels thereafter. Should the Rogue score a critical hit with a sneak atack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

**Trapfinding**: Rogues can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. 

Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

Rogues can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

A Rogue who beats the trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.

**Evasion**: A Rogue can avoid even magical and unusal attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the Rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless Rogue does not gain the benefits of evasion.

**Trap Sense**: A 3rd level Rogue gains a +1 bonus to Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the Rogue reaches 6th level.

**Uncanny Dodge**: Starting at 4th level, a Rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

## Special Ability 

At 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level a Rogue may select one of active assault, combat focus, damage reduction, dark caster, defensive roll, dextrous trip, fast movement, fear aura, greater improved healing, hide in plain sight, improved evasion, improved reaction, improved sneak attac, jester's feint, mettle, moving attack, opportunist, pratfall, rapid stealth, skill mastery, slippery mind, or unshakeable. Then at 4th, 5th, and 6th level he may select two special abilities from the list. Each special ability may only be selected once unless otherwise specified.

**Active Assault**: A Rogue gains the ability to take his 5-foot steps out of turn. If on his turn he would have been allowed to take a 5-foot step but elected not to, he may expend an immediate action any time before his next turn to take a 5-foot step. If he uses this ability he may not use any form of movement on his next turn.

**Combat Focus**: A Rogue begins any combat encounter in combat focus. He may end his combat focus at any time to reroll any die roll he makes, and if not used it ends on its own after a number of combat rounds equal to his class level. Voluntarily ending combat focus requires the use of a swift action (or an immediate action if it is not the Rogue's turn), re-entering combat focus after ending it requires the use of a move action.

**Damage Reduction**: A Rogue gains damage reduction 2/-. This ability may be selected up to 2 times.

**Dark Caster**: A Rogue can learn a spell of 2nd level or lower and cast it a number of times per day equal to Rogue level divided by spell level. Save DC is 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. Treat Rogue level as caster level. This ability may be selected unlimited times.

**Defensive Roll**: If an attack (from a weapon or some other blow) would reduce a Rogue to 0 or fewer hit points. The Rogue may attempt a reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage from the blow.

**Dextrous Trip**: A Rogue may use her dexterity modifier in place of her strength modifier for trip attempts.

**Fast Movement**: The Rogue gains a +10 foot enhancement to his land speed. Apply this bonus before modifying the Rogue's speed because of any load carried or armor. This ability may be selected unlimited times.

**Fear Aura**: A Rogue radiates a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken. A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected by that Rogue's fear aura for 24 hours.

**Greater Improved Healing**: A Rogue gains an enhancement to their natural healing abilities. For every 10 minutes a Rogue spends out of combat they recover 1 hitpoint. This is in addition to hitpoints regained via other methods (resting for example).

**Hide in Plain Sight**: A Rogue with hide in plain sight can use the Hide skill even while being observed (as long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow). He cannot however, hide in his own shadow.

**Improved Evasion**: This ability works like evasion, except that while the Rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless Rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

**Improved Reaction**: A Rogue gains a +2 untyped initiative bonus.

**Improved Sneak Attack**: A Rogue gains an additional 1d6 bonus damage when sneak attacking.

**Jester's Feint**: As a swift action a Rogue may toss a brightly colored object in the square of an enemy with a Stealth check opposed by the enemy’s Spot check. If he succeeds, the enemy is denied his Dex bonus for the Rogue’s next attack. This ability has a range of 30 ft.

An enemy targeted by this ability multiple times gains a +10 bonus to Spot for each prior time he has been targeted, regardless of who won the prior checks. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.

**Mettle**: A Rogue who succeeds a Fortitude partial or Will partial save takes no effect as if she had immunity.

**Moving Attack**: When using the attack action with a melee weapon, a Rogue can move both before and after the attack, provided that the total distance moved is not greater than her speed.

**Opportunist**: Once per round, a Rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.

**Pratfall**: Any time a Rogue strikes an opponent with a melee sneak attack, they may make a free trip attempt which does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Rapid Stealth**: A Rogue does not suffer the -10 penalty to Move Silently or Hide for moving at her full normal speed.

**Skill Mastery**: Upon gaining this ability, the Rogue selects a number of skills equal to 3 + Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skils, he may take 10 even if stress and distraction would normally prevent such a thing. This ability may be gained multiple times.

**Slippery Mind**: If a Rogue with slippery mind fails a will saving throw and suffers an ongoing negative effect, he can attempt it again 1 round later at the original DC - 3. This is the only extra chance to succeed the saving throw.

**Unshakeable**: A Rogue who is reduced to 0 hit points is not disabled (they are not limited to a single move or standard action each round). Additionally, a Rogue with 0 or fewer hit points recovers 1 hit point per round.
