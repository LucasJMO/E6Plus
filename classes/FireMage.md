**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Fire Mages are proficient with all simple weapons, as well as the whip, all martial axes, and all sizes and varieties of scimitar (including falchions). Fire Mages are proficient with light armor, but not shields of any kind.

**Fire Resistance**: A Fire Mage has a resistance to fire equal to twice his class level.

**Fire Burst**: As a standard action, a Fire Mage can emit a burst of flame from his body, striking all creatures and objects within 10’ of his position except himself. This burst of flames inflicts 1d4 of fire damage per class level, with an allowed Reflex Save for half (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + charisma modifier)

**Fire Bolts**: A Fire Mage can throw bolts of fire as a standard action. A Fire Bolt travels out to short range, requires a ranged touch attack to hit, and inflicts 1d4 of Fire damage per Fire Mage level, up to a maximum of 6d4 at 5th level.

**Impress Flames**: Every time a Fire Mage inflicts Fire damage on any target, whether with his class abilities or another source of fire, he inflicts an amount of extra Fire Damage equal to his class level.

**Fire Magic**: A Fire Mage is considered to have every spell with the Fire Descriptor on his spell list for the purpose of activating magic items.

**Ignite**: As a standard action, a 2nd level Fire Mage can cause any creature or object to burst into flame. A creature on fire suffers 1d4 of Fire damage per round on their turn (the Mage’s Impress Flames ability applies to each round, and the creature can attempt to put itself out with a DC 15 Reflex save). This ability can be used out to 25 feet plus 5 feet per two class levels, and it always hits.

**Piercing Flames**: From 3rd level on, a Fire Mage’s fire cuts through Fire Resistance, hardness, and Immunity. No more than 1/2 of the damage inflicted by his fire can be negated by hardness, immunity, or resistance to fire. In addition, the Fire Mage ignores the first 5 points of Fire Resistance that a target has.

**Hands of Fire**: A 3rd level Fire Mage can set fire to their own body, causing them to count as armed at all times, even with unarmed attacks. The Fire Mage also causes an extra 1d4 of Fire damage with all melee attacks.

**Fire Immunity**: At 4th level a Fire Mage is immune to fire.

**Smokeless Flame**: A 4th level Fire Mage can create fires that produce no heat and do not burn. These fires can be anything from the size of a torch to a bonfire, and produce light accordingly. Each lasts for 1 hour per class level. Smokeless Flame can be created anywhere within medium range.

**Fireballs**: A 5th level Fire Mage can hurl explosive fire anywhere within Long Range as a Full Round Action. This Fire explodes into a 20’ radius and inflicts 1d4 of Fire Damage per level. All creatures within the area are entitled to a Reflex save to halve damage (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Charisma Modifier). 

**Mind of Fire**: As a standard action, 6th level Fire Mage can duplicate the effects of rage or confusion for a number of rounds equal to his class level. The target must be within 40 feet, and is entitled to a Will Save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Charisma Modifier). This is a mind influencing compulsion effect, and an individual targeted by this ability cannot be affected by it again for another 24 hours.
