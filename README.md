# E6+

## What is E6+?

E6+ is a game inspired by [**E6: The Game Inside the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game**](https://esix.pbworks.com/f/E6v041.pdf). It was created with the intention of preserving the gritty/heroic fantasy experience of E6, while also providing a greater range of mechanical options.

## Rules

Characters in E6+ begin at level 1 and can reach a maximum level of 6, gaining class abilities and other bonuses as their level increases. A 6th level character cannot gain any further levels, instead for each 5000 experience (or at GM selected intervals) they gain a new feat.

Classes may be selected from the ones specified in this repository, or from other compatible sources (with GM approval).
