# E6+

## What is E6+?

E6+ is a game inspired by [**E6: The Game Inside the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game**](https://esix.pbworks.com/f/E6v041.pdf). It was created with the intention of preserving the gritty/heroic fantasy experience of E6, while also providing a greater range of mechanical options and streamlining elements of character creation.
