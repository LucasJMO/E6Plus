# E6+

## What is E6+?

E6+ is a game inspired by [**E6: The Game Inside the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game**](https://esix.pbworks.com/f/E6v041.pdf). It was created with the intention of preserving the gritty/heroic fantasy experience of E6, while also providing a greater range of mechanical options and streamlining elements of character creation.

## Rule Changes

### Feats

- Feats no longer have ability score prerequisites.
- All characters gain the benefits of the feat Weapon Finesse by default. Additionally it is no longer required as a pre-requisite for any feats or classes.
- All characters gain the benefit of the feat Precise Shot by default. Additionally it is no longer required as a pre-requisite for any feats or classes.
- Point Blank Shot removed as prerequisite for any feats or classes. It can still be taken as a feat if desired.
- Dodge removed as prerequisite for any feats or classes. It can still be taken as a feat if desired.

#### Metamagic

- Prepared casters no longer need to apply metamagic feats while preparing spells. They may instead be applied at casting time.
- Applying metamagic feats at casting time (for prepared or spontaneous casters) does not change the spell's casting time (unless the metamagic feat being applied specifies that it does).

### Skills

- The skills Balance, Climb, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble are removed.
- The skill Acrobatics (Dexterity based with armor check penalty) is added. Any action depending on Balance, Escape Artist, or Tumble is now attempted using Acrobatics.
- The skill Athletics (Strength based with armor check penalty) is added. Any action depending on Climb, Jump, or Swim is now attempted using Athletics.
- The skill Stealth (Dexterity based with armor check penalty) is added. Any action depending on Hide, Move Silently, or Sleight of Hand is now attempted using Stealth.
- The skill Bluff is now opposed by the target's Wisdom modifier (as opposed to the Sense Motive skill).
- The skill Speak Language is added. It is an Intelligence based skill and can be used untrained.
- If you are a single classed character who takes levels in a prestige class, you can treat both the original class's class skills and the prestige class's class skills as class skills.

#### Speak Language

You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus. You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak. You cannot learn a language unless a creature who already speaks the language teaches you, or if you have a language teaching text for that language (this text must be in a language which you can already read).

A literate character (anyone but a Barbarian who has not spent skill points to become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.

You may attempt a Speak Language check to recognize a language being spoken, or to communicate with a creature with which you do not share a common language.

The DC to discern what language is being spoken is 30, with the following modifiers. 

Condition|Modifier
---------|--------
You have not clearly heard at least 15 seconds of the language being spoken|+5
You have not clearly heard at least 30 seconds of the language being spoken|+5
You speak a language which shares an alphabet with the language being spoken|-5
You speak a similar language to the language being spoken|-10

While attempting to communicate with a creature with which you do not share a common language, you must first select a known language as the base for your attempt. The DC is 25 to communicate simple ideas, 35 to communicate moderately complex ideas, and 45 to communicate complex ideas. 

If the base language selected is a similar to a language spoken by the creature gain a +10 to the Speak Language roll. If the base language shares an alphabet with a language spoken by the creature gain an additional +5 to your roll.

You may take 10 or 20 on Speak Language checks.
