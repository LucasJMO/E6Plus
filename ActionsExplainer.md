# Things you can do on your turn

You can take a full round action or a standard action and move action. Additionally each turn/round you can take one swift or immediate action and an unlimited number of free actions.

## Full Round Action

This takes up your entire turn, the only thing you can do apart from this action is take a 5-foot step, but some full-round actions do not allow this. Some full round actions are making a full attack, charging, coup de grtace, running, and withdrawing. 

A full attack is required in order to attack more than one time in your turn if you are gaining attacks through multiple weapons, a double weapon, or a BAB of 6. You specify the target of the next attack after the previous attack resolves.

A charge allows you to move 2 times your speed in a straight line then make 1 attack. You gain a +2 to this attack roll and a -2 penalty to AC until the start of your next turn.

A coup de grace is an attack against an opponent who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or somehow immobilized. You automatically land a critical hit and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10+damage) or die. A coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity. 

Running lets you move 4 times your speed in a straight line. This is reduced to 3 times if you are wearing heavy armor. You also lose dexterity bonus to AC. 

Withdraw lets you move 2 times your normal speed, movement does not have to be in a straight line, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity to start the movement. However subsequent movement through threatened spaces provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. 

## Standard Action/Move Action

During your turn you can take a standard action and a move action, these can be taken in any order. You are still allowed to take a 5-foot step provided you do not use any other form of movement during your turn. 

### Swift Action

You have one swift action which can be taken at any point during your turn. Using your swift action prevents you from taking an immediate action until after the start of your next turn.

### Immediate Action

An immediate action may be taken out of turn, it interrupts the current action in combat and resolves first. 

### Free Action

You have an unlimited number of free actions (within reason). They can be taken in or out of turn.
