# Alternate Rules for Skills

## Class Skills:

A 1st level character may select three additional skills to make class skills.

## Athletics:

The skills Climb, Jump, and Swim are combined into the skill Acrobatics. Bonuses which would be applied to Climb/Jump/Swim checks are instead applied to Athletics checks made to climb/jump/swim.

Any class which had Climb, Jump, or Swim as a class skill gains Athletics as a class skill.

## Bluff:

A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Wisdom modifier. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Wisdom check for each one.

A successful Bluff check indicates that the target cannot tell whether or not you are trying to mislead them. A target may still disbelieve you, if they have other reasons to consider you untrustworthy. 

A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.

### Feinting in Combat

You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Spot check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.

If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Spot check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.

Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

### Creating a Diversion to Hide

You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

## Diplomacy:

You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.

Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a -10 penalty on the check.

Retrying a Diplomacy check is optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.

A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks. If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks. If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Use the table below to determine the effectiveness of Diplomacy checks (or Charisma checks) made to influence the attitude of a nonplayer character, or wild empathy checks made to influence the attitude of an animal or magical beast.

Initial Attitude|Hostile|Unfriendly|Indifferent|Friendly
----------------|-------|----------|-----------|--------
Hostile|Less than 30|30|35|45
Unfriendly|Less than 10|10|25|35
Indifferent|-|Less than 5|5|25
Friendly|-|-|Less than 1|1

Attitude|Means|Possible Actions
--------|-----|----------------
Hostile|Will take risks to hurt you|Attack, interfere, berate, flee
Unfriendly|Wishes you ill|Mislead, gossip, avoid, watch suspiciously, insult
Indifferent|Doesn't much care|Sociall expected interaction
Friendly|Wishes you well|Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate

## Sense Motive:

The Sense Motive skill is removed. 

### Sense Enchantment

You can use a Wisdom check to tell that someone’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn’t aware of it. The DC is 25, but if you are able to cast the spell, or you succeed on a Spellcraft check DC 15 + spell level you gain a +10 bonus to your roll. If you have previously witnessed the effects off the spell you gain a +5 bonus to your roll.

## Speak Language

Speak Language is an Intelligence based skill, it can be used untrained.

You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus. You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak. You cannot learn a language unless a creature who already speaks the language teaches you, or if you have a language teaching text for that language (this text must be in a language which you can already read).

A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill points to become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.

Abyssal|Demons, chaotic evil outsiders|Outsider
Aquan|Water-based creatures|Aquan
Auran|Air-based creatures|Draconic
Celestial|Good outsiders|Outsider

You may attempt a Speak Language check to recognize a language being spoken, or to communicate with a creature with which you do not share a common language.

The DC to discern what language is being spoken is 30, with the following modifiers. 

Condition|Modifier
---------|--------
You have not clearly heard at least 15 seconds of the language being spoken|+5
You have not clearly heard at least 30 seconds of the language being spoken|+5
You speak a language which shares an alphabet with the language being spoken|-5
You speak a similar language to the language being spoken|-10

While attempting to communicate with a creature with which you do not share a common language, you must first select a known language as the base for your attempt. The DC is 25 to communicate simple ideas, 35 to communicate moderately complex ideas, and 45 to communicate complex ideas. 

If the base language selected is a similar to a language spoken by the creature gain a +10 to the Speak Language roll. If the base language shares an alphabet with a language spoken by the creature gain an additional +5 to your roll.

You may take 10 or 20 on Speak Language checks.
