**Special**: For all variations of the feats Expanded Spell Knowledge and Expanded Caster Stamina, the benefits can only be applied to characters whose class casting progression will give them access to 3rd level spells (note that this does not include characters who gain access to these spells through a special class ability). Additionally, cross classing (taking levels of separate classes) nullifies the benefits of these feats. 

**Expanded Spell Knowledge**

Benefit: You learn new spell(s) whose level equals three (round down, and treat new 0th-level spell as ½). Thus, a Sorcerer could learn one 3rd level spell, one 1st, and one 2nd level spells, three 1st level spells, or 6 0th level spells. 

Special: You may select spells at a higher level than you can currently cast, however you do not learn those spells until you reach a level which would allow you to cast them. For example if a 1st level Sorcerer selects a 3rd level spell, they would not learn it until they reached level 6.
