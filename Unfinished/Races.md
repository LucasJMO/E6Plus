## Alternate Rules for Mixed Race Characters

If a player wishes to create a character of mixed racial heritage (for example human/dwarf, dwarf/elf, halfling/elf), they may follow these guidelines to create a racial template for their desired mix. If the mix would include more than two races, then the player must pick two from which to develop the hybrid's racial bonuses.

Alternatively, any hybrid character has the option of simply selecting the racial attributes of one part of its heritage and using those.

# Bonus Feats/Skill Points

If one of the desired races would grant a bonus feat or additional skill points per level, then the hybrid may also gain those bonuses. However, if they choose to do so they must use the racial ability score/skill modifiers of the race granting the bonus feat/skill points. 

# Racial Ability Score Modifiers

If both desired races have ability score modifiers. Then the player may select which set of ability score modifiers to apply.

# Racial Skill Modifiers

If both desired races have skill modifiers. Then the player may select which set of skill modifiers to apply.

# Racial Saving Throw Modifiers

# Spell-Like Abilities

# Natural Armor

# Size 

If the desired races are of different sizes, then the player may pick one, however he must also use the base land speed of the race whose size he selected.

# Base Land Speed

If the desired races are of the same size, but have different base land speeds, then the player must use the lower of the two.
